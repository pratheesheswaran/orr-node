1
00:00:39,785 --> 00:00:42,121
This is our land.

2
00:00:42,955 --> 00:00:45,124
A land of peace and of plenty.

3
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:48,294
A land of harmony and hope.

4
00:00:50,129 --> 00:00:52,465
This is our land.

5
00:00:53,424 --> 00:00:55,343
Oceania.

6
00:00:57,511 --> 00:00:59,639
These are our people.

7
00:01:00,848 --> 00:01:05,102
The workers, the strivers, the builders.

8
00:01:09,523 --> 00:01:11,901
These are our people.

9
00:01:12,735 --> 00:01:16,572
The builders of our world, struggling...

10
00:01:17,114 --> 00:01:19,825
fighting, bleeding...

11
00:01:21,035 --> 00:01:22,495
dying.

12
00:01:22,870 --> 00:01:27,166
On the streets of our cities
and on the far-flung battlefields.

13
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,254
Fighting against the mutilation
of our hopes and dreams.

14
00:01:37,093 --> 00:01:38,553
Who are they?

15
00:01:39,345 --> 00:01:42,223
Eurasia! Eurasia!

16
00:01:44,016 --> 00:01:46,269
They are the dark armies.

17
00:01:47,937 --> 00:01:51,148
The dark, murdering armies of Eurasia.

18
00:01:53,609 --> 00:01:56,529
In the barren deserts of Africa and India...

19
00:01:56,904 --> 00:01:58,906
on the oceans of Australasia...

20
00:01:58,990 --> 00:02:02,451
courage, strength, and youth are sacrificed.

21
00:02:03,244 --> 00:02:08,082
Sacrificed to barbarians,
whose only honor is atrocity.

22
00:02:13,629 --> 00:02:16,048
But even as we grasp at victory...

23
00:02:16,382 --> 00:02:19,218
there is a cancer, an evil tumor...

24
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:23,180
growing, spreading in our midst.

25
00:02:24,015 --> 00:02:26,684
Shout, shout...

26
00:02:26,851 --> 00:02:28,728
shout out his name!

27
00:02:29,103 --> 00:02:31,105
Goldstein!

28
00:02:34,609 --> 00:02:37,361
Nothing the Party says is true.

29
00:02:37,778 --> 00:02:40,281
Nothing the Party does is good.

30
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:43,826
Even the war itself isn't real.

31
00:02:45,161 --> 00:02:47,830
The Party wants you to believe
we are at war...

32
00:02:47,955 --> 00:02:52,001
so as to channel your aggressions
away from their rightful target...

33
00:02:52,126 --> 00:02:53,461
the Party.

34
00:02:54,921 --> 00:02:56,672
Big Brother is not real.

35
00:02:58,049 --> 00:03:00,843
He is pure fiction, created by the Party.

36
00:03:01,552 --> 00:03:03,721
The real rulers of the State...

37
00:03:03,804 --> 00:03:06,891
are unknown, faceless manipulators...

38
00:03:06,974 --> 00:03:09,101
who, because they are not known...

39
00:03:09,227 --> 00:03:12,730
are able to wield power
without let or hindrance.

40
00:03:14,273 --> 00:03:18,152
People of Oceania, you are being duped.

41
00:03:19,111 --> 00:03:22,490
The Party doesn't serve the people,
it serves itself.

42
00:03:23,032 --> 00:03:25,326
We are not at war with Eurasia.

43
00:03:26,452 --> 00:03:29,247
Death! Death! Traitor!

44
00:03:30,790 --> 00:03:33,167
You are being made into obedient...

45
00:03:33,292 --> 00:03:36,128
stupid slaves of the Party.

46
00:03:37,296 --> 00:03:39,173
Open your eyes.

47
00:03:39,674 --> 00:03:42,301
See the evil that is happening to you.

48
00:03:42,969 --> 00:03:46,055
The Party drops bombs on its own citizens.

49
00:03:46,180 --> 00:03:47,139
Traitor!

50
00:03:47,223 --> 00:03:50,768
It is the Party, not the Eurasians,
who are our enemies.

51
00:03:52,562 --> 00:03:53,813
Rise up.

52
00:03:54,355 --> 00:03:56,065
Throw off the yoke.

53
00:03:56,566 --> 00:04:01,070
You have nothing to lose,
and everything to gain.

54
00:04:02,196 --> 00:04:04,490
People of Oceania.

Intransigence, rendered as crime.

58
00:05:57,270 --> 00:05:58,229

"from 20 to 25 Grams Per Week."

63
00:07:56,305 --> 00:08:00,059
I confess to spreading the rumor,
on orders from Goldstein...

64
00:08:00,768 --> 00:08:04,272
that the war is not really with Eurasia,
but with Eastasia.

65
00:08:05,273 --> 00:08:09,652
That, for years, in fact since the days
of our glorious Revolution...

66
00:08:09,777 --> 00:08:11,904
I had no faith in our future.

67
00:08:13,030 --> 00:08:16,409
I forged government announcements
and falsified figures...

68
00:08:16,492 --> 00:08:19,745
quoted for agricultural
and industrial production.

69
00:08:20,538 --> 00:08:25,459
As a result of mental disturbance from
my experiences during the atomic wars...

70
00:08:26,294 --> 00:08:29,630
I was a willing subject
of Goldstein's influence.

71
00:08:30,464 --> 00:08:32,884
I was stubborn and egocentric.

72
00:08:32,967 --> 00:08:36,554
When ownlife thoughts occurred to me,
I reveled in them.

73
00:08:36,804 --> 00:08:39,265
I went into the proletarian zones...

74
00:08:39,390 --> 00:08:43,769
I had sex with prostitutes,
I deliberately contracted syphilis.

75
00:08:45,146 --> 00:08:48,441
It was at this time
that I made contact with the Resistance.

76
00:08:48,941 --> 00:08:53,112
I was personally contacted
by the archtraitor, Goldstein...

77
00:08:53,195 --> 00:08:56,365
and ordered to assassinate
certain Inner Party officials.

78
00:08:56,490 --> 00:08:57,491
Bugger!

79
00:08:57,617 --> 00:08:58,951
This I did.

80
00:09:00,244 --> 00:09:04,457
My agents forged documents
and gained entry into the Ministry...

81
00:09:04,582 --> 00:09:06,500
"Thought crime is death.

82
00:09:07,919 --> 00:09:10,379
"Thought crime does not entail death.

"the essential crime

86
00:09:23,100 --> 00:09:26,979
I have spent many hours
of my free time, encouraging my agents...

87
00:09:27,063 --> 00:09:30,483
to deface Party posters
and hoarding announcements.

88
00:09:31,359 --> 00:09:34,237
I read and memorized Goldstein's book.

89
00:09:34,862 --> 00:09:38,824
For 30 years,
I have plotted to bring down the Party.

90
00:09:39,367 --> 00:09:41,410
I was sick in mind and body.

91
00:09:42,203 --> 00:09:45,998
Together with my colleagues,
Aaronson and Rutherford...

92
00:09:46,415 --> 00:09:49,544
I did counterfeit
important Party documents...

93
00:09:51,003 --> 00:09:54,507
including ex-London permits
and travel passes.

94
00:09:55,007 --> 00:09:57,635
And that by use of these documents...

95
00:09:57,969 --> 00:10:01,180
my agents traveled freely
throughout Airstrip One...

96
00:10:01,264 --> 00:10:04,725
encouraging insurrection
and organizing a massive counterplot...

97
00:10:04,850 --> 00:10:08,521
to destroy the innermost faction
of the Oceanian leadership.

98
00:10:10,565 --> 00:10:12,024
Furthermore...

99
00:10:13,067 --> 00:10:17,029
I used my position of privilege
within the Inner Party...

100
00:10:17,905 --> 00:10:20,825
to pervert and betray the truth at all times...

101
00:10:20,908 --> 00:10:25,830
and to suggest, wherever possible,
that our traditional allies in Eastasia...

102
00:10:26,664 --> 00:10:28,708
were in fact, our deadly enemies.

103
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,961
"April the 4th, 1984. "

104
00:10:32,086 --> 00:10:34,755

00:10:34,922 --> 00:10:36,007
"I think..."

106
00:10:36,090 --> 00:10:38,050
I stole military plans...

107
00:10:38,342 --> 00:10:42,513
and, at vast financial profit,
sold them to the Eurasian leadership.

108
00:10:42,638 --> 00:10:44,265
"...to the past...

109
00:10:44,932 --> 00:10:46,767

Right, let's see which one of us
can touch his toes.

117
00:12:00,508 --> 00:12:03,886
Right over from the hips,
brothers and sisters, please.

118
00:12:04,136 --> 00:12:06,097
One, two.

119
00:12:16,065 --> 00:12:19,652
Smith? 6079, Smith, W.?

120
00:12:20,820 --> 00:12:21,779
Yes, you.

121

Bend lower.

122
00:12:24,782 --> 00:12:27,159
You're not trying. Watch me.

123
00:12:35,710 --> 00:12:38,170
There, brother. That's what I want.

124
00:12:38,838 --> 00:12:42,341
Anyone under 45 is perfectly
capable of touching his toes.

125
00:12:42,717 --> 00:12:45,136
I'm 39, and I've had four children.

126
00:12:45,303 --> 00:12:48,514
We don't all have the privilege
of fighting in the front line.

127
00:12:48,598 --> 00:12:51,100
Remember our boys on the Malabar Front.

128
00:12:51,309 --> 00:12:54,020
Just think what they have to put up with.

129
00:12:55,730 --> 00:12:59,525
Production of water-heaters
is up 1.5 percent.

130
00:13:00,735 --> 00:13:03,237
Switchgear, 4.5 percent.

131
00:13:03,446 --> 00:13:05,948
Electrical wiring, 10 percent.

132
00:13:06,574 --> 00:13:08,451
Cigarettes, 18 percent.

133
00:13:08,659 --> 00:13:10,953
Bricks, 3 percent.

134
00:13:11,287 --> 00:13:12,830
Morning, Smith.

135
00:13:12,914 --> 00:13:14,123
Parsons.

136
00:13:16,167 --> 00:13:17,710
Heard the rumor?

137
00:13:17,960 --> 00:13:19,545
No. Good news, is it?

138
00:13:19,712 --> 00:13:21,589
I should say so, yes.

139
00:13:21,923 --> 00:13:23,716
Choco rations going up.

140
00:13:24,050 --> 00:13:25,134
Really?

141
00:13:25,551 --> 00:13:27,637
Twenty-five grams next week.

142
00:13:28,012 --> 00:13:29,430
Doubleplus good.

143
00:13:30,765 --> 00:13:33,142
Speakwrites, 14 percent.

144
00:13:33,267 --> 00:13:35,895
Vibra-aging castings, 9 percent.

145
00:13:36,187 --> 00:13:40,483
By the way, Smith, I seem to have run out
of razor blades for some reason.

146
00:13:40,608 --> 00:13:43,361
You wouldn't happen to have any spare,
would you?

147
00:13:43,444 --> 00:13:45,947
I'm sorry, brother. I'm on the last one.

148
00:13:46,697 --> 00:13:48,157
Bandages, 9 percent.

149
00:13:48,699 --> 00:13:51,702
In 1983, Oceania's coal output...

150
00:13:51,786 --> 00:13:54,205
reached 630 million tons.

151
00:13:55,122 --> 00:13:59,752
In 1976, coal output was 605 million tons...

152
00:14:00,169 --> 00:14:02,380
an increase of 4. 1 percent.

153
00:14:03,214 --> 00:14:05,800
5.3 million tractors were produced...

154
00:14:06,133 --> 00:14:09,053
an increase of 17.6 percent.

155
00:14:09,929 --> 00:14:11,639
6.1 million trucks...

156
00:14:11,764 --> 00:14:14,517
I wanted to ask you if you've got
any razor blades?

157
00:14:14,642 --> 00:14:16,686
I've tried all over the place.

158
00:14:16,811 --> 00:14:19,605
I've been using the same one for six weeks.

159
00:14:19,814 --> 00:14:23,150
... a staggering increase of 93.4 percent.

160
00:14:24,694 --> 00:14:27,029
Did you see the prisoners
hanged yesterday?

161
00:14:27,154 --> 00:14:30,283
No, I was working.
But I shall see it on the screens.

162
00:14:40,877 --> 00:14:43,212
You'll pick up the gin on the way?

163
00:14:46,215 --> 00:14:47,675
I'll have two.

164
00:14:52,471 --> 00:14:56,976
2.9 million Airstrip One
Mark 5 submachine guns...

165
00:14:57,977 --> 00:15:02,189
3.1 million Grenville gas-operated
light machine guns...

166
00:15:02,356 --> 00:15:03,524
Give me a gin.

00:15:03,649 --> 00:15:08,613

and 1.4 million lightweight...

spigot-launching,
anti-tank rocket projectors.

172
00:15:23,044 --> 00:15:24,712
Food production is also up...

173
00:15:24,837 --> 00:15:27,924
- How's the Newspeak Committee?
- Working overtime.

174
00:15:28,216 --> 00:15:31,219
... butter, 2 percent, milk, 6 percent.

175

Plusbig waste is in adjectives.

176
00:15:35,306 --> 00:15:39,018
Plusbig problem is timing the language
to scientific advance.

177
00:15:43,564 --> 00:15:46,609
It's a beautiful thing,
the destruction of words.

178
00:15:48,945 --> 00:15:52,406
You won't have seen the Dictionary,
10th edition yet, Smith?

179
00:15:52,865 --> 00:15:54,408
It's that thick.

180
00:15:55,117 --> 00:15:57,787
The 11th edition will be that thick.

181
00:16:00,248 --> 00:16:03,751
So the Revolution will be complete
when the language is perfect.

182
00:16:03,876 --> 00:16:08,130
The secret's to move from translation,
to direct thought, to automatic response.

183
00:16:08,256 --> 00:16:12,426
No need for self-discipline.
Language coming from here, not from here.

184
00:16:12,635 --> 00:16:14,136
Excuse me for intruding.

185
00:16:14,262 --> 00:16:17,682
You're saying that we'll be rid of
the last vestiges of Goldsteinism...

186
00:16:17,765 --> 00:16:19,767
when the language has been cleaned.

187
00:16:19,850 --> 00:16:23,271
- I couldn't agree with you more, brother.
- Absolutely.

188
00:16:27,191 --> 00:16:30,319
Praise be to our leader
and the Party workers!

189
00:16:34,782 --> 00:16:37,869
Other munitions production figures
are as follows.

190
00:16:38,536 --> 00:16:41,747
70,000 M-20 tank destroyers...

191
00:16:41,873 --> 00:16:43,916
with 76-mm cannon.

192
00:16:45,167 --> 00:16:46,335
Smith. Syme.

193
00:16:50,840 --> 00:16:53,175
It's encouraging to think that by 2050...

194
00:16:53,301 --> 00:16:57,179
not a single person will be able
to have a conversation like this.

195
00:16:57,471 --> 00:16:58,639
Except the proles?

196
00:16:58,764 --> 00:17:01,267
The proletariat don't count. They're animals.

197
00:17:02,143 --> 00:17:03,895
See the hanging?

198
00:17:04,478 --> 00:17:05,938
Missed it, myself.

199
00:17:06,063 --> 00:17:07,732
Bloody committees.

200
00:17:11,402 --> 00:17:15,990
35,000 Black Eagle 500 cc motorbicycles.

201
00:17:19,160 --> 00:17:20,995
Doubleplus good, this.

202
00:17:21,787 --> 00:17:25,666
You know, I don't think
there's a single piece of meat in this stew.

203
00:17:27,210 --> 00:17:29,670
Looks like meat. Tastes like meat.

204
00:17:30,546 --> 00:17:32,215
It isn't meat at all.

205
00:17:32,506 --> 00:17:34,050
Doubleplus good.

206
00:17:35,218 --> 00:17:36,802
Not like it, Smith?

207
00:17:36,928 --> 00:17:38,971
Yes, it's too rich for me.

208
00:17:39,388 --> 00:17:41,140
Do you mind if I"... "

209
00:17:41,682 --> 00:17:45,478
Brothers and sisters,
the battle for production has been won.

210
00:17:45,686 --> 00:17:48,522
Completed returns
show that the standard of living...

211
00:17:48,648 --> 00:17:51,817
has risen by no less than 20 percent
over the last year.

212
00:17:52,526 --> 00:17:56,948
All over Oceania there've been spontaneous
demonstrations of Party workers...

213
00:17:57,031 --> 00:17:59,408
voicing their gratitude and joy!

214
00:18:00,201 --> 00:18:04,664
In honor of this massive overfulfillment
of the ninth three-year plan...

215
00:18:04,747 --> 00:18:09,669
it's been announced that chocolate ration
is to be increased to 25 grams per week!

216
00:18:18,386 --> 00:18:20,096
"If there is hope...

217
00:18:20,471 --> 00:18:22,390
"it lies in the proles.

218
00:18:23,349 --> 00:18:26,143
"If they could become conscious
of their own strength...

219
00:18:26,227 --> 00:18:28,896
"they would have no need to conspire.

220
00:18:29,230 --> 00:18:31,524
"History does not matter to them.

221
00:18:42,285 --> 00:18:44,161
"It was three years ago...

222
00:18:45,413 --> 00:18:47,206
"on a dark evening.

223
00:18:48,249 --> 00:18:50,209
"Easy to slip the patrols.

224
00:18:50,668 --> 00:18:53,379
"And I'd gone into the proletarian areas.

225
00:18:56,883 --> 00:19:00,219
"There was no one else in the street,
and no telescreens.

226
00:19:06,392 --> 00:19:08,269
"She said, '$2. '

227
00:19:11,063 --> 00:19:12,732
"So I went with her.

228
00:19:16,319 --> 00:19:18,112
"She had a young face...

229
00:19:19,447 --> 00:19:21,032
"painted very thick.

230
00:19:24,744 --> 00:19:27,121
"It was really the paint that appealed to me...

231
00:19:27,246 --> 00:19:29,540
"the whiteness of it, like a mask...

232
00:19:30,374 --> 00:19:32,335
"and the bright red lips."

233
00:19:35,504 --> 00:19:36,714
Come on.

234
00:19:52,146 --> 00:19:54,106
"There were no preliminaries.

235
00:19:55,399 --> 00:19:59,487
"Standing there, with the scent
of dead insects and cheap perfume...

236
00:19:59,612 --> 00:20:02,448
"I went ahead and did it, just the same."

237
00:21:04,468 --> 00:21:06,262
Rutherford unperson.

238
00:21:06,554 --> 00:21:08,180
Substitute Ogilvy.

239
00:21:09,056 --> 00:21:11,392
Ogilvy bio, details as follows:

240
00:21:12,226 --> 00:21:13,519
"War hero.

241
00:21:13,978 --> 00:21:16,272
"Recently killed, Malabar Front.

242
00:21:16,898 --> 00:21:20,985
"Today awarded posthumous
Order of Conspicuous Merit, Second Class."

243
00:21:29,452 --> 00:21:31,662
I accuse myself of sabotage...

244
00:21:32,288 --> 00:21:34,665
embezzlement of Party funds...

245
00:21:35,166 --> 00:21:37,376
sale of military secrets...

246
00:21:37,460 --> 00:21:40,546
of being in the pay
of the Government of Eurasia...

247
00:21:40,671 --> 00:21:44,175
of being a sexual pervert
and a thoughtcriminal.

248
00:21:46,010 --> 00:21:49,639
I exploited my trusted position
at the Ministry of Peace...

249
00:21:49,805 --> 00:21:52,433
to mislead our allies in Eastasia...

250
00:21:53,017 --> 00:21:57,980
and also to corrupt youth by means
of seditious literature and drugs.

251
00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:03,569
I am guilty on all counts.

252
00:22:04,695 --> 00:22:05,947
I stand here...

253
00:22:06,072 --> 00:22:08,157
a victim of the influence of...

254
00:22:08,282 --> 00:22:10,826
"Under the spreading chestnut tree...

255
00:22:11,452 --> 00:22:12,745
"I sold you...

256
00:22:13,454 --> 00:22:14,956
"you sold me."

257
00:22:17,083 --> 00:22:18,626
And I ask only...

258
00:22:19,752 --> 00:22:20,962
for you to accept...

259
00:22:22,046 --> 00:22:23,839
my love of our leader.

260
00:23:59,060 --> 00:24:00,519
Can I help you?

261
00:24:05,733 --> 00:24:07,360
Anything special?

262
00:24:08,528 --> 00:24:09,779
I was here before.

263
00:24:11,280 --> 00:24:12,740
Razor blades.

264
00:24:15,368 --> 00:24:17,245
You sold me the notebook.

265
00:24:17,370 --> 00:24:18,371
Yes.

266
00:24:21,290 --> 00:24:22,542
Please look around.

267
00:24:49,235 --> 00:24:50,570
What's this?

268
00:24:51,988 --> 00:24:53,823
It's a beautiful thing.

269
00:24:54,782 --> 00:24:56,492
Over 100 years old.

270
00:25:00,288 --> 00:25:02,081
Cost you $4.

271
00:25:20,099 --> 00:25:23,561
There's another room upstairs
that you might like to see.

272
00:25:24,020 --> 00:25:26,063
But there's not much in it.

273
00:25:27,148 --> 00:25:28,774
Just a few things.

274
00:26:02,475 --> 00:26:04,018
My woman's dead.

275
00:26:04,852 --> 00:26:07,480
I'm just trying to sell the furniture.

276
00:26:12,693 --> 00:26:14,487
It's a beautiful bed...

277
00:26:14,946 --> 00:26:17,323
if you can get the bugs out of it.

278
00:26:28,334 --> 00:26:30,127
Interested in old prints at all?

279
00:26:36,759 --> 00:26:40,221
The frame's fixed to the wall,
but I daresay I could unscrew it.

280
00:26:40,304 --> 00:26:42,431
How did this escape?

281
00:26:43,349 --> 00:26:44,976
I know what it is.

282
00:26:45,643 --> 00:26:49,355
It's the museum in the street
outside the Palace of Justice.

283
00:26:49,814 --> 00:26:54,277
"Oranges and lemons,"
say the bells of St. Clement's.

284
00:26:54,694 --> 00:26:56,153
What was that?

285
00:26:58,322 --> 00:26:59,782
Something old.

286
00:27:27,768 --> 00:27:29,186
War is peace!

287
00:27:30,354 --> 00:27:32,064
Freedom is slavery!

288
00:27:32,899 --> 00:27:34,734
Ignorance is strength!

289
00:27:38,696 --> 00:27:41,657
A triumph of willpower over the orgasm.

290
00:27:42,783 --> 00:27:46,162
At a rally of the Anti-Sex League
in Victory Square tonight...

291
00:27:46,287 --> 00:27:50,124
held to celebrate a 50-percent decrease
in civil marriages...

292
00:27:50,291 --> 00:27:53,669
over 10,000 Party women
took a vow of celibacy...

293
00:27:53,794 --> 00:27:57,089
and pledged themselves as vessels
for the artificial insemination...

294
00:27:57,173 --> 00:27:58,633
"I hate her.

295
00:27:59,300 --> 00:28:02,094
"I should kill her before she denounces me.

296
00:28:03,554 --> 00:28:07,141
"I have disliked her
from the first moment of seeing her. "

297
00:29:12,039 --> 00:29:13,457
Sector 43...

298
00:29:14,208 --> 00:29:16,419
929 male...

299
00:29:16,878 --> 00:29:19,171
753 female.

300
00:29:20,047 --> 00:29:21,841
Sector 44...

301
00:29:21,924 --> 00:29:23,676
437 male...

302
00:29:24,677 --> 00:29:26,220
609 female.

303
00:29:27,889 --> 00:29:29,181
Sector 45...

304
00:29:29,891 --> 00:29:32,310
222 male...

305
00:29:32,476 --> 00:29:34,061
220 female.

306
00:29:35,021 --> 00:29:36,314
Sector 46...

307
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:38,608
- Are you hurt?
- It's nothing.

308
00:29:40,776 --> 00:29:42,153
It's my arm.

309
00:29:43,446 --> 00:29:45,615
I'll be all right in a second.

310
00:29:45,990 --> 00:29:47,658
Brother, could you"... "

311
00:29:56,500 --> 00:29:58,085
Are you all right?

312
00:29:58,377 --> 00:29:59,754
It's nothing.

313
00:30:00,838 --> 00:30:03,341
I only gave my wrist a bit of a bang.

314
00:30:05,468 --> 00:30:07,178
Thank you, brother.

315
00:31:07,154 --> 00:31:08,447
Who is she?

316
00:31:09,490 --> 00:31:12,535
All I know is that she works
in the corner section...

317
00:31:12,660 --> 00:31:16,080
probably on the proletarian
novel-writing machines.

318
00:31:27,174 --> 00:31:29,260
Mrs. Parsons? A spanner?

319
00:31:30,386 --> 00:31:32,388
Under the sink, beside you.

320
00:31:52,700 --> 00:31:54,410
Thank you, brother.

321
00:31:54,869 --> 00:31:58,331
I wouldn't have had to bother you,
but my husband's out late.

322
00:31:58,873 --> 00:32:00,166
Committees.

323
00:32:00,458 --> 00:32:02,835
You know what us Parsons are like.

324
00:32:03,127 --> 00:32:05,213
You're a thoughtcriminal.

325
00:32:08,299 --> 00:32:11,010
They haven't been out much.

326
00:32:12,053 --> 00:32:13,304
Thank you, brother.

327
00:32:13,387 --> 00:32:15,806
Attention! Your attention, please!

328
00:32:16,182 --> 00:32:19,852
A newsflash has this moment arrived
from the Malabar Front.

329
00:32:19,977 --> 00:32:24,315
The forces of Oceania in South India
have won a glorious victory.

330
00:32:25,066 --> 00:32:28,194
I am authorized to say
that the war against Eurasia...

331
00:32:28,319 --> 00:32:31,155
is within measurable distance of its end.

332
00:32:31,239 --> 00:32:34,659
40,000 Eurasian soldiers
have been killed or captured.

333
00:33:31,424 --> 00:33:32,967
Can you hear me?

334
00:33:33,551 --> 00:33:34,552
Yes.

335
00:33:35,303 --> 00:33:37,597
Do you have an ex-London permit?

336
00:33:38,264 --> 00:33:39,307
Yes.

337
00:33:40,016 --> 00:33:42,393
Can you get Sunday afternoon off?

338
00:33:44,061 --> 00:33:45,104
Yes.

339
00:33:45,313 --> 00:33:46,606
Take this.

340
00:33:51,611 --> 00:33:54,780
It's quite precise. I rely on you to destroy it.

341
00:33:55,990 --> 00:33:57,992
Are you sure you can come?

342
00:33:58,492 --> 00:33:59,577
Yes.

343
00:34:52,171 --> 00:34:53,839
On your own, brother?

344
00:34:55,758 --> 00:34:58,553
No, I'm joining the Vic Mans
community hiking group.

345
00:34:59,387 --> 00:35:01,889
I was held up on urgent Minrec business.

346
00:35:12,525 --> 00:35:16,696
Sing to the bravest on the sturdy fortress

347
00:35:16,779 --> 00:35:21,284
Sing to the soldiers on the battlefields

348
00:35:21,576 --> 00:35:25,788
Sing to the airmen in the burning azure

349
00:35:26,038 --> 00:35:30,001
Sing to the farmers' rising yields

350
00:35:30,501 --> 00:35:34,839
We are the children, builders of the future

351
00:35:35,006 --> 00:35:39,385
And we the children swear to thee

352
00:35:39,594 --> 00:35:44,015
Loyal devotion, fearless devotion

353
00:35:44,098 --> 00:35:48,394
And to die with dignity

354
00:35:48,603 --> 00:35:50,646
Sing to the faithful...

355
00:35:55,276 --> 00:35:57,069
A daring and resourceful maneuver...

356
00:35:57,153 --> 00:35:59,989
under the personal direction
of B.B. himself...

357
00:36:00,114 --> 00:36:03,993
ensuring the total annihilation of
the Eurasian heavy-armored divisions...

358
00:36:48,829 --> 00:36:49,789
Look.

359
00:36:55,169 --> 00:36:56,629
It's a dream.

360
00:37:01,592 --> 00:37:02,927
I want you.

361
00:37:05,096 --> 00:37:06,305
Not here.

362
00:37:07,181 --> 00:37:09,642
Come back to the woods, it's safer.

363
00:37:22,947 --> 00:37:24,907
Have you done this before?

364
00:37:25,199 --> 00:37:26,492
Of course.

365
00:37:27,368 --> 00:37:28,995
Hundreds of times.

366
00:37:30,705 --> 00:37:32,498
- With Party members?
- Yes.

367
00:37:33,374 --> 00:37:35,001
Inner Party members?

368
00:37:35,126 --> 00:37:38,129
Not with those bastards.
Though there's plenty who would.

369
00:37:38,254 --> 00:37:40,715
Look, I hate purity.

370
00:37:42,008 --> 00:37:43,426
I hate goodness.

371
00:37:43,968 --> 00:37:46,554
I don't want virtue to exist anywhere.

372
00:37:47,179 --> 00:37:48,931
I want everyone corrupt.

373
00:37:49,056 --> 00:37:51,058
I ought to suit you, then.

374
00:37:51,809 --> 00:37:53,728
I'm corrupt to the core.

375
00:37:54,228 --> 00:37:56,105
Do you like doing this?

376
00:37:57,732 --> 00:37:59,483
I don't mean just me.

377
00:38:00,318 --> 00:38:01,652
I adore it.

378
00:39:09,512 --> 00:39:10,763
Winston?

379
00:39:11,472 --> 00:39:14,767
We shall meet in the place
where there is no darkness.

380
00:39:29,615 --> 00:39:34,412
Adult literacy amongst the proletariat
has risen by 56 percent.

381
00:39:35,371 --> 00:39:39,292
The proletarian infant mortality rate
has dropped by 12 percent.

382
00:39:39,876 --> 00:39:44,755
Incidences of leukemia, tuberculosis,
and meningitis have dropped considerably.

383
00:39:45,798 --> 00:39:49,969
Improved diet has been responsible
for a dramatic decrease in rickets.

384
00:39:50,511 --> 00:39:52,805
Eye diseases show a steep drop.

385
00:39:53,222 --> 00:39:56,309
So, too, do deaths
from pneumonia and smallpox.

386
00:39:56,893 --> 00:39:59,645
The improvement in
sewerage and drainage systems...

387
00:39:59,812 --> 00:40:02,190
has resulted in better health, overall.

388
00:40:03,441 --> 00:40:07,111
State rodent operatives
report a 50-percent reduction...

389
00:40:07,236 --> 00:40:10,823
in the number of vermin
in the central proletarian zones.

390
00:40:11,908 --> 00:40:14,493
I just want to finish by saying a few words...

391
00:40:14,619 --> 00:40:18,831
about the impact
of this imminent neurological breakthrough.

392
00:40:20,208 --> 00:40:23,377
When the orgasm
has been finally eradicated...

393
00:40:23,711 --> 00:40:27,590
the last remaining obstacle
to the psychological acceptance...

394
00:40:27,715 --> 00:40:32,053
of the principles of Ingsoc,
as applied to artsem, will be overcome.

395
00:40:32,720 --> 00:40:36,390
In other words, the unorthodox tendencies
towards ownlife...

396
00:40:37,058 --> 00:40:40,394
which constantly threaten
the natural erosion of the family unit...

397
00:40:40,728 --> 00:40:44,524
will no longer have
the biological support of the organism.

398
00:40:45,525 --> 00:40:50,029
As we all know, the biological and
social stimulation of the family leads to...

399
00:40:50,321 --> 00:40:53,449
private reflection, outside Party needs...

400
00:40:53,908 --> 00:40:57,119
and to the establishment
of unorthodox loyalties...

401
00:40:57,245 --> 00:40:59,872
which can only lead to thoughtcrime.

402
00:41:00,706 --> 00:41:05,002
The introduction of artsem, combined
with the neutralization of the orgasm...

403
00:41:05,086 --> 00:41:08,089
will effectively render obsolete the family...

404
00:41:08,256 --> 00:41:11,592
until it becomes impossible
to conceptualize.

405
00:41:12,593 --> 00:41:13,844
Thank you.

406
00:41:29,735 --> 00:41:31,362
Excuse me, brother.

407
00:41:33,489 --> 00:41:35,533
You dropped your ink pencil.

408
00:41:35,950 --> 00:41:37,451
Thank you, sister.

409
00:41:41,455 --> 00:41:43,624
A pincer movement has developed...

410
00:41:43,749 --> 00:41:47,712
involving the floating fortresses
of the Eurasian 17th Fleet...

411
00:42:07,565 --> 00:42:08,774
Not much.

412
00:42:12,653 --> 00:42:14,989
Not much left at all, these days.

413
00:42:15,531 --> 00:42:16,699
Walls.

414
00:42:18,242 --> 00:42:19,869
Police don't like us much.

415
00:42:21,537 --> 00:42:22,914
That room...

416
00:42:23,831 --> 00:42:25,166
how much?

417
00:42:26,209 --> 00:42:27,960
$4 a week.

418
00:42:52,985 --> 00:42:54,654
Traitor!

419
00:43:03,663 --> 00:43:05,331
Traitor! Criminal!

420
00:43:27,895 --> 00:43:30,857
Big, Big, Big...

421
00:43:40,616 --> 00:43:43,661
A vast military buildup
of armored divisions...

422
00:43:43,911 --> 00:43:48,541
missiles and floating fortresses,
accompanied by a fourfold increase...

423
00:43:48,791 --> 00:43:51,544
in the number of
radio-controlled rocket bombs...

424
00:43:51,669 --> 00:43:55,673
directed at the most
densely populated areas of Airstrip One...

425
00:43:57,800 --> 00:43:59,260
It is folly...

426
00:43:59,760 --> 00:44:03,556
as though deliberately,
we move one step nearer the grave.

427
00:44:04,640 --> 00:44:07,560
I can't understand why
she accepted the idea...

428
00:44:08,436 --> 00:44:10,396
she, who is so careful.

429
00:44:23,242 --> 00:44:24,327
Hello.

430
00:44:28,706 --> 00:44:30,458
Let me show you what I've brought.

431
00:44:39,967 --> 00:44:41,052
Look.

432
00:44:44,513 --> 00:44:45,806
What is it?

433
00:44:46,849 --> 00:44:48,142
Real sugar.

434
00:44:49,477 --> 00:44:50,895
Not saccharin.

435
00:44:51,938 --> 00:44:55,149
And I've got a loaf of bread,
proper white bread...

436
00:44:56,442 --> 00:44:57,693
and jam.

437
00:44:59,946 --> 00:45:01,614
A real tin of milk.

438
00:45:04,492 --> 00:45:05,535
Look.

439
00:45:08,829 --> 00:45:09,997
Coffee.

440
00:45:12,667 --> 00:45:14,001
Real coffee.

441
00:45:14,669 --> 00:45:16,671
Inner Party. Half a kilo.

442
00:45:18,548 --> 00:45:20,967
How did you manage
to get ahold of all this?

443
00:45:21,050 --> 00:45:23,844
There's nothing those bastards don't have.

444
00:45:27,014 --> 00:45:28,599
Aren't you pleased?

445
00:45:28,724 --> 00:45:29,767
Yes.

446
00:45:30,726 --> 00:45:32,019
Of course.

447
00:45:39,443 --> 00:45:40,653
Real tea.

448
00:45:41,779 --> 00:45:43,990
There's been a lot of tea about lately.

449
00:45:44,115 --> 00:45:46,617
They've captured India or something.

450
00:45:49,203 --> 00:45:50,496
I want you.

451
00:45:51,873 --> 00:45:53,249
I want you, too.

452
00:45:55,042 --> 00:45:56,085
Wait.

453
00:45:57,503 --> 00:46:00,172
Turn around, and don't look until I tell you.

454
00:46:19,859 --> 00:46:21,319
Listen to that.

455
00:46:22,778 --> 00:46:26,657
How can she make a song
written by a machine sound so beautiful?

456
00:46:33,664 --> 00:46:35,583
You can turn around now.

457
00:46:51,307 --> 00:46:53,392
- I...
- Winston...

458
00:46:58,898 --> 00:47:00,358
Do you like me?

459
00:47:04,612 --> 00:47:06,072
More than ever.

460
00:47:22,338 --> 00:47:25,383
Was there ever a time
when this seemed ordinary?

461
00:47:30,638 --> 00:47:33,182
Attention! Your attention, please!

462
00:47:34,308 --> 00:47:38,312
A vast military buildup
has been reported in the Sahara Desert...

463
00:47:38,563 --> 00:47:41,399
sectors 17 and 18 of the war zone.

464
00:47:42,275 --> 00:47:44,318
14 heavy-tank divisions...

465
00:47:44,819 --> 00:47:48,239
"There is truth, and there is untruth."

466
00:47:48,364 --> 00:47:52,326
... have been sighted proceeding in convoy
in a northerly direction...

467
00:47:52,451 --> 00:47:53,786
"Freedom...

468
00:47:54,078 --> 00:47:57,456
"is the freedom to say
two plus two equals four.

469
00:47:58,666 --> 00:48:00,376
"If that is granted...

470
00:48:01,002 --> 00:48:02,628
"all else follows."

471
00:48:02,753 --> 00:48:04,630
That is the end of the announcement.

472
00:48:05,298 --> 00:48:10,219
We'll rehab the war from a neutral zone,
remaking dust in interstate plusplan levels.

473
00:48:10,511 --> 00:48:14,599
Intend ego 1980 level
in dust output by 48 percent.

474
00:48:14,724 --> 00:48:16,309
Stop, end emission.

475
00:49:05,608 --> 00:49:08,152
Re: "Times", 31-10-81.

476
00:49:09,654 --> 00:49:14,450
Brother Tillotson wins Mini chess.
Request photo. File follows.

477
00:49:41,269 --> 00:49:43,729
Attention. Your attention, please.

478
00:49:43,938 --> 00:49:47,191
Will all Outer Party members
of Ways and Means Committees...

479
00:49:47,275 --> 00:49:51,404
please attend their local
community centers for discussions and...

480
00:49:51,487 --> 00:49:54,031
"Under the spreading chestnut tree...

481
00:49:54,866 --> 00:49:58,077
"I sold you, you sold me."

482
00:49:59,954 --> 00:50:02,957
The meetings begin at 20... 00 hours.

483
00:50:08,296 --> 00:50:09,463
Smith?

484
00:50:11,632 --> 00:50:14,844
I've been reading
your Newspeak articles in "The Times."

485
00:50:15,136 --> 00:50:16,220
Yes.

486
00:50:16,596 --> 00:50:19,932
You write very elegantly.
That is not my own opinion.

487
00:50:20,474 --> 00:50:24,228
I was recently talking to a friend of yours,
who is an expert.

488
00:50:24,312 --> 00:50:27,190
His name has slipped my memory
for a moment.

489
00:50:27,648 --> 00:50:32,445
What I wanted to say was, that there were
one or two unwords, only very recent.

490
00:50:33,404 --> 00:50:36,949
Have you seen the 10th edition
of the Newspeak Dictionary?

491
00:50:37,366 --> 00:50:40,453
No, we're still using
the 9th edition at Minrec.

492
00:50:40,870 --> 00:50:44,790
A few advance copies
have been segregated. I have one myself.

493
00:50:47,293 --> 00:50:49,086
You might be interested.

494
00:50:49,170 --> 00:50:50,213
Yes.

495
00:50:50,838 --> 00:50:53,799
There are some plus skillful
new developments.

496
00:50:54,217 --> 00:50:56,260
Let me give you my address.

497
00:50:59,138 --> 00:51:01,599
I'm usually at home in the evenings.

498
00:51:01,724 --> 00:51:04,769
If not, my servant
will give you the dictionary.

499
00:51:16,864 --> 00:51:19,158
14,000 Victory Vampires...

500
00:51:19,700 --> 00:51:22,078
6, 700 Ingsoc cadets...

501
00:51:22,828 --> 00:51:25,498
4,600 Ingsoc sea cadets...

502
00:51:26,290 --> 00:51:29,669
12,300 Porteous piloted missiles...

503
00:51:30,211 --> 00:51:32,964
31,000 Victory fighter bombers...

504
00:51:33,631 --> 00:51:36,133
23,000 Big Brother heavy bombers.

505
00:51:36,384 --> 00:51:38,386
"It has happened at last.

506
00:51:39,095 --> 00:51:40,721
"The call has come.

507
00:51:41,973 --> 00:51:45,685
"It seems that all my life...

508
00:51:46,853 --> 00:51:48,646
"I've been waiting for it."

509
00:51:48,729 --> 00:51:52,066
... is to be named after
Sub-lieutenant Ogilvy...

510
00:51:52,191 --> 00:51:54,569
hero of the State of Oceania...

511
00:51:55,111 --> 00:51:59,448
recently awarded, posthumously,
the Order of Conspicuous Gallantry...

512
00:51:59,574 --> 00:52:02,493
for his action
in the recent glorious victory...

513
00:52:02,577 --> 00:52:06,664
over the forces of Eastasia
on the Malabar Front, in South India.

514
00:52:35,739 --> 00:52:37,907
Half the water's boiled away.

515
00:52:42,912 --> 00:52:44,831
What does the clock say?

516
00:52:46,583 --> 00:52:48,335
It says 21:00 hours.

517
00:52:51,796 --> 00:52:54,382
What time do they cut the light
in your flats?

518
00:52:54,507 --> 00:52:55,592
23:30.

519
00:52:56,551 --> 00:52:58,470
At the hostel it's 23:00.

520
00:53:04,100 --> 00:53:05,435
What is it?

521
00:53:05,894 --> 00:53:07,312
I don't know.

522
00:53:08,647 --> 00:53:12,108
A little chunk of history
that they've forgotten to alter.

523
00:53:12,859 --> 00:53:14,903
Message from 100 years ago.

524
00:53:25,789 --> 00:53:29,167
"Oranges and lemons,"
say the bells of St. Clement's.

525
00:53:29,292 --> 00:53:32,921
"You owe me three farthings,"
say the bells of St. Martin's."

526
00:53:33,046 --> 00:53:35,715
Who taught you that? What is it?

527
00:53:37,509 --> 00:53:39,969
I don't know. I just know it.

528
00:53:47,060 --> 00:53:49,437
You know, the only thing to do...

529
00:53:50,021 --> 00:53:52,774
is to walk out of here before it's too late...

530
00:53:52,857 --> 00:53:55,151
and never see one another again.

531
00:53:56,361 --> 00:53:57,404
Yes.

532
00:53:58,321 --> 00:54:00,073
Our luck can't last.

533
00:54:03,034 --> 00:54:04,494
You're young...

534
00:54:05,829 --> 00:54:08,206
you look normal, you're innocent.

535
00:54:08,331 --> 00:54:11,835
You keep clear of people like me,
and you might stay alive.

536
00:54:13,211 --> 00:54:15,088
What you do, I do.

537
00:54:17,424 --> 00:54:18,633
I've thought it out.

538
00:54:22,679 --> 00:54:24,639
I'm good at staying alive.

539
00:54:37,110 --> 00:54:39,070
When shall we meet again?

540
00:54:39,529 --> 00:54:42,073
Not for several weeks. It's not safe.

541
00:54:49,998 --> 00:54:51,708
Give me half an hour.

542
00:54:57,380 --> 00:54:58,465
I love you.

543
00:55:04,679 --> 00:55:05,722
Julia...

544
00:55:07,390 --> 00:55:09,851
Do you think the Resistance is real?

545
00:55:10,727 --> 00:55:11,728
No.

546
00:55:12,103 --> 00:55:13,647
None of it's real.

547
00:55:51,017 --> 00:55:54,187
Steamer! Dead overhead! Get down!

548
00:56:45,155 --> 00:56:49,284
...round the clock, plus a 153 sets
in eyes top a P.M.A. Willmer.

549
00:56:52,829 --> 00:56:55,123
"Oceania is at war with Eastasia.

550
00:56:55,457 --> 00:56:58,376
"Oceania has always been
at war with Eastasia.

551
00:56:58,835 --> 00:57:02,714
"Eurasia is our ally.
Eurasia has always been our ally.

552
00:57:04,507 --> 00:57:06,593
"Everything fades into mist.

553
00:57:07,302 --> 00:57:10,347
"The past is erased, the erasure forgotten.

554
00:57:11,306 --> 00:57:14,934
"A lie becomes truth
and then becomes a lie again."

555
00:57:52,931 --> 00:57:54,265
What is it?

556
00:57:59,354 --> 00:58:00,689
I dreamt...

557
00:58:03,525 --> 00:58:05,235
about my mother.

558
00:58:10,365 --> 00:58:11,783
What, darling?

559
00:58:30,093 --> 00:58:32,303
It was during the wars...

560
00:58:33,513 --> 00:58:35,140
before the Party.

561
00:58:48,945 --> 00:58:50,113
Winston!

562
00:59:01,833 --> 00:59:03,668
I couldn't help myself.

563
00:59:05,670 --> 00:59:07,630
I knew what I had done...

564
00:59:08,590 --> 00:59:10,633
and I couldn't help myself.

565
00:59:30,320 --> 00:59:33,490
When I went back, hours later...

566
00:59:36,117 --> 00:59:38,370
my mother and sister were gone.

567
00:59:41,414 --> 00:59:43,291
I never saw them again.

568
00:59:53,510 --> 00:59:56,012
So it's not just staying alive.

569
00:59:56,638 --> 00:59:58,973
It's staying human that's important.

570
01:00:02,143 --> 01:00:03,603
What counts...

571
01:00:03,979 --> 01:00:06,106
is that we don't betray each other.

572
01:00:07,357 --> 01:00:10,402
If you mean confessing,
we're bound to do that.

573
01:00:11,027 --> 01:00:12,404
Everybody does.

574
01:00:13,029 --> 01:00:14,489
You can't help it.

575
01:00:15,156 --> 01:00:17,117
I don't mean confessing.

576
01:00:17,492 --> 01:00:19,494
Confessing isn't betrayal.

577
01:00:21,413 --> 01:00:22,956
I mean feelings.

578
01:00:25,166 --> 01:00:27,919
If they can make me change my feelings...

579
01:00:29,671 --> 01:00:32,007
they can stop me from loving you.

580
01:00:34,217 --> 01:00:36,302
That will be real betrayal.

581
01:00:39,431 --> 01:00:41,099
They can't do that.

582
01:00:42,475 --> 01:00:44,811
It's the one thing they can't do.

583
01:00:45,186 --> 01:00:47,022
They can torture you...

584
01:00:47,897 --> 01:00:49,899
and make you say anything.

585
01:00:51,860 --> 01:00:54,362
But they can't make you believe it.

586
01:00:56,614 --> 01:00:58,616
They can't get inside you.

587
01:00:58,700 --> 01:01:00,827
They can't get to your heart.

588
01:01:05,248 --> 01:01:07,208
I'm going to see O'Brien.

589
01:01:09,044 --> 01:01:10,211
I know.

Davis, Miniprod, Women's Section.

612
01:02:40,844 --> 01:02:43,972
That concludes the list
of known agents of Goldstein...

613
01:02:44,097 --> 01:02:46,850
actively engaged in the latest conspiracy...

614
01:02:46,975 --> 01:02:50,312
Not much of this gets
to the Outer Party, I'm afraid.

615
01:02:52,230 --> 01:02:53,273
To our leader.

616
01:02:53,356 --> 01:02:57,319
... that our eternal allies in Eurasia
are turning against us.

617
01:02:58,987 --> 01:03:02,741
More nests of conspirators
and saboteurs have been uncovered...

618
01:03:02,824 --> 01:03:05,618
and further arrests are expected shortly.

619
01:03:13,251 --> 01:03:14,252
You can...

620
01:03:15,253 --> 01:03:18,298
Yes. We are allowed that privilege.

621
01:03:20,008 --> 01:03:21,634
Some more of this?

622
01:03:22,218 --> 01:03:23,803
It's called wine.

623
01:03:37,108 --> 01:03:41,946
There are thoughtcriminals
who maintain the Resistance is not real.

624
01:03:43,281 --> 01:03:45,116
Believe me, Winston...

625
01:03:45,825 --> 01:03:47,327
it is very real.

626
01:03:49,454 --> 01:03:52,290
Perhaps you are not familiar
with how it operates.

627
01:03:52,415 --> 01:03:54,709
I'm attentive to the news.

628
01:03:55,794 --> 01:03:56,920
Indeed.

629
01:03:57,253 --> 01:04:00,590
Perhaps you imagine
a huge network of conspirators...

630
01:04:00,715 --> 01:04:03,426
prepared to commit
any atrocity to demoralize...

631
01:04:03,551 --> 01:04:05,970
and weaken the order of our society.

632
01:04:06,513 --> 01:04:09,099
The reality is infinitely more subtle.

633
01:04:11,226 --> 01:04:13,103
If Goldstein himself...

634
01:04:13,728 --> 01:04:18,650
fell into the hands of the Thought Police,
he could not give them a list of his agents.

635
01:04:19,275 --> 01:04:21,319
Such a list does not exist.

636
01:04:23,071 --> 01:04:26,241
They're not an organization
in the sense we know.

637
01:04:27,742 --> 01:04:29,953
Nothing holds it together but an idea.

638
01:04:31,454 --> 01:04:34,708
There is no possibility of change
in their lifetime.

639
01:04:35,333 --> 01:04:37,502
In the face of the Thought Police...

640
01:04:37,752 --> 01:04:39,754
they cannot act collectively.

641
01:04:40,922 --> 01:04:43,425
Individually, they cheat...

642
01:04:44,384 --> 01:04:47,095
forge, blackmail, corrupt children...

643
01:04:47,220 --> 01:04:49,514
spread disease and prostitution...

644
01:04:51,891 --> 01:04:56,021
in the name of spreading knowledge
from generation to generation.

645
01:04:56,313 --> 01:04:57,480
Until...

646
01:04:59,149 --> 01:05:00,984
in a thousand years...

647
01:05:08,533 --> 01:05:11,119
You may find this of interest.

648
01:05:17,375 --> 01:05:18,668
Thank you.

649
01:05:29,512 --> 01:05:33,266
... address a rally in Victory Square
at 21... 30 hours.

650
01:05:34,142 --> 01:05:36,645
That is the end of the announcement.

651
01:05:40,148 --> 01:05:41,733
Goodbye, brother.

652
01:05:52,702 --> 01:05:56,331
They have attacked an unarmed village
with rocket bombs...

653
01:05:56,456 --> 01:06:00,377
and murdered 4,000 defenseless, innocent...

654
01:06:00,502 --> 01:06:03,380
and peaceful citizens of Oceania.

655
01:06:05,507 --> 01:06:07,384
This is no longer war.

656
01:06:07,509 --> 01:06:09,678
This is cold-blooded murder.

657
01:06:11,930 --> 01:06:15,350
Until now, the war has been conducted
with honor...

658
01:06:15,725 --> 01:06:17,018
and bravery...

659
01:06:17,102 --> 01:06:21,606
with the ideals of truth and justice,
in the best traditions of mankind...

660
01:06:22,190 --> 01:06:24,317
until this moment.

661
01:06:26,778 --> 01:06:28,655
Brothers and sisters...

662
01:06:29,197 --> 01:06:32,534
the endless catalogue of bestial atrocities...

663
01:06:32,659 --> 01:06:35,495
which will inevitably ensue
from this appalling act...

664
01:06:35,578 --> 01:06:39,040
must, can, and will be terminated.

665
01:06:43,920 --> 01:06:46,089
The forces of darkness
and treasonable maggots...

666
01:06:46,214 --> 01:06:49,384
who collaborate with them,
must, can, and will...

667
01:06:49,676 --> 01:06:52,387
be wiped from the face of the earth.

668
01:06:53,054 --> 01:06:54,597
We must crush them.

669
01:06:54,723 --> 01:06:56,683
We must smash them.

670
01:06:56,766 --> 01:06:58,601
We must stamp them out.

671
01:07:00,103 --> 01:07:03,148
We, the people of Oceania...

672
01:07:07,444 --> 01:07:11,531
... will not rest until a final victory
has been achieved.

673
01:07:12,699 --> 01:07:16,745
Death to the eternal enemy of Oceania.

674
01:07:18,038 --> 01:07:18,997
Death!

675
01:07:26,755 --> 01:07:28,590
Brothers and sisters...

676
01:07:29,090 --> 01:07:31,426
one week from now...

677
01:07:32,344 --> 01:07:34,179
in this very square...

678
01:07:35,055 --> 01:07:38,350
we shall,
as a demonstration of our resolve...

679
01:07:39,225 --> 01:07:42,187
as a sure sign to those
who attempt to threaten...

680
01:07:42,270 --> 01:07:44,272
our Party and our State...

681
01:07:44,689 --> 01:07:47,317
we shall execute publicly...

682
01:07:47,442 --> 01:07:50,695
the same number of Eastasian prisoners...

683
01:07:50,820 --> 01:07:54,324
by hanging, drawing and quartering.

684
01:07:58,161 --> 01:08:00,372
Big, Big, Big...

685
01:08:45,667 --> 01:08:48,837
"In accordance to the principles
of Doublethink...

686
01:08:48,962 --> 01:08:51,589
"it does not matter if the war is not real...

687
01:08:51,673 --> 01:08:54,676
"or when it is, that victory is not possible.

688
01:08:55,010 --> 01:08:59,306
"The war is not meant to be won.
It is meant to be continuous.

689
01:09:00,223 --> 01:09:02,684
"The essential act of modern warfare...

690
01:09:02,809 --> 01:09:05,937
"is the destruction of the produce
of human labor.

01:09:07,022 --> 01:09:11,651
"A hierarchical society is only possible
on the basis of poverty and ignorance.

"The war is waged by the ruling group

"And its object is not victory

696
01:09:29,711 --> 01:09:33,214
"but to keep the very structure
of society intact."

697
01:09:38,887 --> 01:09:40,013
Julia?

698
01:09:41,306 --> 01:09:42,766
Are you awake?

699
01:10:02,535 --> 01:10:05,121
There is truth, and there is untruth.

700
01:10:07,248 --> 01:10:10,293
To be in a minority of one
doesn't make you mad.

701
01:10:15,256 --> 01:10:16,883
Julia, my love...

702
01:10:18,927 --> 01:10:20,470
I understand how.

703
01:10:22,430 --> 01:10:24,265
I don't understand why.

704
01:10:48,164 --> 01:10:49,499
I'm hungry.

705
01:10:51,751 --> 01:10:53,837
Let's make some more coffee.

706
01:11:11,855 --> 01:11:13,023
The water's cold.

707
01:11:22,324 --> 01:11:24,075
There's no oil in it.

708
01:11:25,702 --> 01:11:28,288
That's strange. I thought it was full.

709
01:11:32,000 --> 01:11:36,880
They say that time heals all things

710
01:11:38,673 --> 01:11:43,637
They say you can always forget

711
01:11:45,930 --> 01:11:49,851
But the smiles and the tears

712
01:11:50,101 --> 01:11:53,772
across the years

713
01:11:54,773 --> 01:11:59,319
they twist my heartstrings yet.

714
01:11:59,402 --> 01:12:00,945
She's beautiful.

715
01:12:06,910 --> 01:12:09,871
She's a meter across the hips. Easily.

716
01:12:10,538 --> 01:12:12,457
It's her style of beauty.

717
01:12:17,837 --> 01:12:19,547
The future is hers.

718
01:12:28,056 --> 01:12:29,557
We are the dead.

719
01:12:31,768 --> 01:12:33,311
We are the dead.

720
01:12:34,354 --> 01:12:35,939
You are the dead.

721
01:12:38,400 --> 01:12:40,527
Remain exactly where you are.

722
01:12:40,860 --> 01:12:43,279
Make no move until you are ordered.

723
01:12:48,576 --> 01:12:50,078
Now they can see us.

724
01:12:50,203 --> 01:12:51,913
Now we can see you.

725
01:12:52,247 --> 01:12:54,207
Clasp your hands behind your heads.

726
01:12:55,709 --> 01:12:59,212
Stand out in the middle of the room.
Stand back-to-back.

727
01:12:59,921 --> 01:13:01,881
Do not touch one another.

728
01:13:04,843 --> 01:13:06,469
The house is surrounded.

729
01:13:06,594 --> 01:13:08,471
The house is surrounded.

730
01:13:10,140 --> 01:13:12,350
I suppose we may as well say goodbye.

731
01:13:12,434 --> 01:13:15,687
You may as well say goodbye.
While we're on the subject...

732
01:13:15,770 --> 01:13:18,565
"Here comes a candle to light you to bed.

733
01:13:18,982 --> 01:13:21,776
"Here comes a chopper
to chop off your head."

734
01:14:35,475 --> 01:14:36,893
Pick that up.

735
01:14:52,701 --> 01:14:54,160
Thought Police.

736
01:15:32,907 --> 01:15:35,994
6079 Smith. Open your eyes.

737
01:16:02,312 --> 01:16:03,605
Parsons.

738
01:16:06,232 --> 01:16:08,151
Keep away from me, Smith.

739
01:16:10,236 --> 01:16:12,197
I'm an agent of Goldstein.

740
01:16:17,786 --> 01:16:19,704
I didn't know it myself.

741
01:16:22,165 --> 01:16:25,043
Thoughtcrime is so insidious.

742
01:16:27,003 --> 01:16:28,963
It just creeps up on you.

743
01:16:36,846 --> 01:16:38,807
My daughter found it out.

744
01:16:40,558 --> 01:16:42,185
Very proud of her.

745
01:16:44,437 --> 01:16:48,149
Very grateful I've been discovered
before it's too late.

746
01:16:54,280 --> 01:16:56,783
They won't shoot me, will they, Smith?

747
01:16:57,909 --> 01:17:00,954
I know I could be very useful
in a labor camp.

748
01:17:10,130 --> 01:17:11,840
Room 101.

749
01:17:19,597 --> 01:17:20,557
No.

750
01:17:22,100 --> 01:17:25,645
Please, you don't have to take me there.

751
01:17:27,188 --> 01:17:28,148
Why?

752
01:17:28,898 --> 01:17:31,192
There's nothing I won't confess.

753
01:17:32,319 --> 01:17:33,486
Nothing.

754
01:17:34,863 --> 01:17:36,990
I've told you everything already.

755
01:17:38,616 --> 01:17:40,869
What is it you want me to know?

756
01:17:43,955 --> 01:17:45,832
Take him instead of me.

757
01:17:46,374 --> 01:17:49,210
He's the thoughtcriminal. It's him you want.

758
01:18:41,262 --> 01:18:42,889
They got you, too.

759
01:18:43,682 --> 01:18:45,767
They got me a long time ago.

760
01:18:49,312 --> 01:18:51,815
You knew this would happen, Winston.

761
01:18:51,940 --> 01:18:54,943
Don't deceive yourself.
You've always known it.

762
01:19:12,627 --> 01:19:16,756
The photos of you and the girl
will be recycled for proletarian use.

763
01:19:56,338 --> 01:19:58,798
Do you know where you are, Winston?

764
01:20:01,176 --> 01:20:02,552
I don't know.

765
01:20:03,845 --> 01:20:05,180
I can guess.

766
01:20:06,640 --> 01:20:08,558
In the Ministry of Love.

767
01:20:09,559 --> 01:20:12,145
Do you know how long you've been here?

768
01:20:12,729 --> 01:20:13,772
No.

769
01:20:15,190 --> 01:20:16,316
Weeks?

770
01:20:17,525 --> 01:20:18,652
Months?

771
01:20:19,861 --> 01:20:22,238
Do you know why you're here?

772
01:20:25,742 --> 01:20:28,536
Shall I tell you why we brought you here?

773
01:20:29,329 --> 01:20:30,705
To cure you.

774
01:20:31,373 --> 01:20:32,957
To make you sane.

775
01:20:44,719 --> 01:20:46,054
That was 40.

776
01:20:46,137 --> 01:20:49,599
You can see that the numbers
on this dial run up to 100.

777
01:20:50,850 --> 01:20:53,728
Will you please remember
that, during our conversation?

778
01:20:53,853 --> 01:20:57,524
I have it in my power
to inflict pain on you at any time...

779
01:20:57,607 --> 01:20:59,985
and in whatever degree I choose.

780
01:21:06,658 --> 01:21:10,412
You know perfectly well
what is the matter with you, Winston.

781
01:21:10,620 --> 01:21:14,708
You've known it for years, though
you've fought against the knowledge.

782
01:21:14,833 --> 01:21:16,835
You are mentally deranged.

783
01:21:17,544 --> 01:21:19,963
You suffer from a defective memory.

784
01:21:21,423 --> 01:21:24,801
You never tried to cure yourself of it,
because you did not choose to.

785
01:21:25,260 --> 01:21:29,180
It was a small effort of will,
which you were not ready to make.

786
01:21:31,266 --> 01:21:32,726
For example...

787
01:21:33,852 --> 01:21:36,604
which power is Oceania at war with?

788
01:21:38,440 --> 01:21:39,858
Eastasia.

789
01:21:42,027 --> 01:21:44,446
Oceania is at war with Eastasia.

790
01:21:45,613 --> 01:21:46,823
Eastasia.

791
01:21:47,615 --> 01:21:48,700
Good.

792
01:21:49,284 --> 01:21:53,038
And Oceania has always been at war
with Eastasia, has it not?

793
01:21:55,707 --> 01:21:58,460
Tell me what you think you remember.

794
01:22:03,631 --> 01:22:05,258
I remember...

795
01:22:07,177 --> 01:22:10,221
that until only a week
before I was arrested...

796
01:22:11,056 --> 01:22:13,683
we weren't at war with Eastasia at all.

797
01:22:15,477 --> 01:22:16,978
It was Eurasia.

798
01:22:19,522 --> 01:22:21,691
That lasted four years, I think.

799
01:22:21,816 --> 01:22:23,318
Another example.

800
01:22:23,985 --> 01:22:25,570
A serious delusion.

801
01:22:27,489 --> 01:22:30,742
Photographs about which
you've had hallucinations...

802
01:22:31,660 --> 01:22:34,454
which you believed you held in your hand.

803
01:22:36,790 --> 01:22:38,500
They never existed.

804
01:22:47,092 --> 01:22:49,427
Say what you were about to say, Winston.

805
01:22:49,511 --> 01:22:50,971
They exist...

806
01:22:52,597 --> 01:22:53,890
in memory.

807
01:22:55,934 --> 01:22:57,310
I remember.

808
01:22:58,895 --> 01:23:00,355
You remember.

809
01:23:01,731 --> 01:23:03,400
I do not remember.

810
01:23:04,693 --> 01:23:08,238
Only the disciplined mind
can see reality, Winston.

811
01:23:10,365 --> 01:23:12,826
It needs an act of self-destruction...

812
01:23:13,118 --> 01:23:14,619
an effort of the will.

813
01:23:15,870 --> 01:23:18,206
Do you remember writing in your diary:

814
01:23:18,289 --> 01:23:22,293
"Freedom is the freedom to say
two plus two equals four?"

815
01:23:24,462 --> 01:23:25,505
Yes.

816
01:23:25,922 --> 01:23:28,300
How many fingers am I holding up?

817
01:23:28,883 --> 01:23:29,926
Four.

818
01:23:30,385 --> 01:23:34,931
And if the Party says there are not four,
but five, then how many?

819
01:23:36,224 --> 01:23:37,267
Five.

820
01:23:44,524 --> 01:23:45,525
No.

821
01:23:47,068 --> 01:23:49,529
That's no use. You're lying.

822
01:23:51,239 --> 01:23:53,408
How many fingers, please?

823
01:23:57,287 --> 01:23:59,539
Four. What else could I say?

824
01:24:02,208 --> 01:24:05,503
Five, or anything you like.
Will you please stop it?

825
01:24:07,130 --> 01:24:08,632
Stop the pain.

826
01:24:13,053 --> 01:24:14,721
How can I help it?

827
01:24:17,766 --> 01:24:20,935
How can I help
what I see in front of my eyes?

828
01:24:22,937 --> 01:24:24,856
Two and two makes four.

829
01:24:26,066 --> 01:24:27,776
Sometimes, Winston.

830
01:24:28,526 --> 01:24:31,946
Sometimes they are five,
sometimes they are three.

831
01:24:33,114 --> 01:24:35,742
Sometimes they are all of them at once.

832
01:24:45,293 --> 01:24:49,255
Neither the past, nor the present,
nor the future...

833
01:24:49,881 --> 01:24:51,841
exists in its own right.

834
01:24:52,717 --> 01:24:54,886
Reality is in the human mind...

835
01:24:56,137 --> 01:24:58,306
not in the individual mind...

836
01:24:59,057 --> 01:25:02,394
which makes mistakes and soon perishes...

837
01:25:04,104 --> 01:25:06,356
but in the mind of the Party...

838
01:25:07,023 --> 01:25:10,318
which is collective and immortal.

839
01:25:14,197 --> 01:25:16,074
- Again.
- No.

840
01:25:23,957 --> 01:25:25,959
How many fingers, Winston?

841
01:25:28,253 --> 01:25:29,337
Four.

842
01:25:30,797 --> 01:25:33,049
Four, I suppose there are four.

843
01:25:34,009 --> 01:25:35,802
I tried to see five.

844
01:25:37,554 --> 01:25:39,139
I wish I could.

845
01:25:39,222 --> 01:25:40,515
Which do you wish?

846
01:25:40,598 --> 01:25:44,311
To persuade me that you can see five,
or really to see them?

847
01:25:44,853 --> 01:25:46,521
Really to see them.

848
01:25:49,232 --> 01:25:50,317
Again.

849
01:25:59,409 --> 01:26:00,994
How many, Winston?

850
01:26:12,881 --> 01:26:14,299
I don't know.

851
01:26:19,262 --> 01:26:20,430
Better.

852
01:26:38,615 --> 01:26:42,410
No one escapes, Winston.
There are no martyrs here.

853
01:26:43,787 --> 01:26:46,456
All the confessions made here are true.

854
01:26:47,957 --> 01:26:51,252
We do not destroy the heretic
because he resists us.

855
01:26:52,253 --> 01:26:55,298
As long as he resists us,
we never destroy him.

856
01:26:56,341 --> 01:26:59,386
We make him one of ourselves
before we kill him.

857
01:27:00,303 --> 01:27:03,390
We make his brain perfect
before we blow it out.

858
01:27:04,599 --> 01:27:05,934
And then...

859
01:27:07,060 --> 01:27:11,064
when there is nothing left
but sorrow and love of Big Brother...

860
01:27:11,940 --> 01:27:14,567
we shall lift you clean out of history.

861
01:27:15,235 --> 01:27:19,030
We shall turn you into gas
and pour you into the stratosphere.

862
01:27:19,948 --> 01:27:21,950
Nothing will remain of you.

863
01:27:22,575 --> 01:27:24,494
Not a name in a register.

864
01:27:25,203 --> 01:27:27,497
Not a memory in a living brain.

865
01:27:28,748 --> 01:27:32,502
You will be annihilated in the past,
as well as in the future.

866
01:27:34,879 --> 01:27:36,089
Three thousand.

867
01:27:44,514 --> 01:27:46,599
This time it won't hurt you.

868
01:27:48,810 --> 01:27:51,604
Before we bring this session to an end...

869
01:27:52,230 --> 01:27:54,691
I want you to ask me your questions.

870
01:27:55,025 --> 01:27:57,235
I want you to clear your mind.

871
01:28:00,780 --> 01:28:01,865
Julia.

872
01:28:02,782 --> 01:28:04,701
She betrayed you, Winston...

873
01:28:04,826 --> 01:28:07,120
immediately, unreservedly.

874
01:28:08,371 --> 01:28:12,709
All her rebellion, deceit,
folly, dirty-mindedness...

875
01:28:12,834 --> 01:28:14,836
has been turned out of her.

876
01:28:18,465 --> 01:28:20,342
Does Big Brother exist?

877
01:28:21,343 --> 01:28:22,636
Of course.

878
01:28:25,221 --> 01:28:26,973
The same way as me?

879
01:28:29,017 --> 01:28:30,602
You do not exist.

880
01:28:34,481 --> 01:28:38,693
You've not asked me the question
that is uppermost in your mind.

881
01:28:39,736 --> 01:28:41,905
You know what is in Room 101.

882
01:28:43,657 --> 01:28:46,034
Everyone knows what's in Room 101.

883
01:28:50,789 --> 01:28:51,915
Now...

884
01:28:53,041 --> 01:28:54,876
fix your eyes on mine.

885
01:29:12,102 --> 01:29:14,854
What country is Oceania at war with?

886
01:29:18,525 --> 01:29:20,110
I don't remember.

887
01:29:20,902 --> 01:29:23,405
Oceania is at war with Eastasia.

888
01:29:24,114 --> 01:29:25,907
Do you remember that now?

889
01:29:26,032 --> 01:29:27,117
Yes.

890
01:29:28,994 --> 01:29:31,371
How many fingers am I holding up?

891
01:29:33,373 --> 01:29:34,374
Five.

892
01:29:35,375 --> 01:29:38,461
You see, at least, that it is possible.

893
01:29:42,841 --> 01:29:45,760
You've understood the reality of the past...

894
01:29:46,219 --> 01:29:47,887
and of the present.

895
01:29:49,514 --> 01:29:51,266
Now for the future.

896
01:29:53,435 --> 01:29:55,020
A question:

897
01:29:55,854 --> 01:29:58,773
"How does one man
assert power over another?"

898
01:30:01,109 --> 01:30:02,944
By making him suffer.

899
01:30:03,236 --> 01:30:06,239
Exactly. Obedience is not enough.

900
01:30:08,158 --> 01:30:12,245
Power is inflicting pain and humiliation.
Otherwise, you cannot be sure.

901
01:30:12,704 --> 01:30:15,623
Power is tearing human minds apart...

902
01:30:17,042 --> 01:30:21,129
and putting them together again
in new shapes of your own choosing.

903
01:30:21,713 --> 01:30:24,174
Power is not a means, it is an end.

904
01:30:25,133 --> 01:30:29,512
In our world, there will only be triumph
and self-abasement.

905
01:30:30,680 --> 01:30:33,058
Everything else, we shall destroy.

906
01:30:33,767 --> 01:30:36,186
The past is forbidden. Why?

907
01:30:37,687 --> 01:30:40,815
Because when we can cut man
from his own past...

908
01:30:41,316 --> 01:30:45,737
then we can cut him from his family,
his children, other men.

909
01:30:48,448 --> 01:30:51,493
There is no loyalty,
except loyalty to the Party.

910
01:30:53,119 --> 01:30:56,039
There is no love, except love of Big Brother.

911
01:30:56,623 --> 01:31:00,502
All competing pleasures, we will destroy.

912
01:31:02,963 --> 01:31:06,341
If you want a vision of the future, imagine...

913
01:31:06,466 --> 01:31:09,177
a boot stamping on a human face forever.

914
01:31:17,268 --> 01:31:20,313
You are thinking
that my face is old and tired...

915
01:31:21,731 --> 01:31:23,900
that while I talk of power...

916
01:31:24,025 --> 01:31:27,112
I'm unable to prevent
the decay of my own body.

917
01:31:29,072 --> 01:31:31,533
But the individual is only a cell.

918
01:31:32,826 --> 01:31:36,579
And the weariness of the cell
is the vigor of the organism.

919
01:31:37,122 --> 01:31:39,541
- You'll fail.
- Why?

920
01:31:41,292 --> 01:31:42,836
It's impossible.

921
01:31:44,296 --> 01:31:47,924
Hatred, the fear of life.

922
01:31:48,717 --> 01:31:51,094
Why is hate less vital than love?

923
01:31:52,095 --> 01:31:53,555
I don't know.

924
01:31:53,722 --> 01:31:55,682
But somehow you'll fail.

925
01:31:56,558 --> 01:31:58,560
Something will defeat you.

926
01:32:00,020 --> 01:32:01,896
Life will defeat you.

927
01:32:02,355 --> 01:32:05,191
We control life at all levels.

928
01:32:06,568 --> 01:32:08,486
We create human nature.

929
01:32:09,571 --> 01:32:11,698
Men are infinitely malleable.

930
01:32:13,241 --> 01:32:17,871
Or perhaps you've returned to your old idea
that the proletarians will arise.

931
01:32:18,455 --> 01:32:20,415
Put it out of your mind.

932
01:32:20,915 --> 01:32:22,959
They are helpless animals.

933
01:32:23,793 --> 01:32:25,920
Humanity is the body.

934
01:32:27,505 --> 01:32:31,301
I don't care. In the end, they'll beat you.

935
01:32:32,427 --> 01:32:35,513
Sooner or later, they'll tear you to pieces.

936
01:32:37,432 --> 01:32:39,017
On what evidence?

937
01:32:40,727 --> 01:32:42,395
Goldstein's book.

938
01:32:43,772 --> 01:32:47,734
I wrote it.
Or, at least, I collaborated in writing it.

939
01:32:48,610 --> 01:32:51,571
No book is individually produced,
as you know.

940
01:32:53,156 --> 01:32:55,116
I just believe it.

941
01:32:57,285 --> 01:32:58,995
I know you'll fail.

942
01:33:00,664 --> 01:33:02,666
Something in this world...

943
01:33:03,667 --> 01:33:06,586
some spirit you will never overcome"... "

944
01:33:07,462 --> 01:33:09,506
What is it, this principle?

945
01:33:10,799 --> 01:33:12,425
I don't know.

946
01:33:13,802 --> 01:33:15,428
The spirit of man.

947
01:33:16,763 --> 01:33:19,015
And do you consider yourself a man?

948
01:33:19,808 --> 01:33:20,850
Yes.

949
01:33:23,645 --> 01:33:26,272
If you are a man, you're the last man.

950
01:33:27,732 --> 01:33:29,484
Your kind is extinct.

951
01:33:30,318 --> 01:33:32,153
We are the inheritors.

952
01:33:33,989 --> 01:33:36,616
Do you understand that you are alone?

953
01:33:38,410 --> 01:33:40,328
You are outside history.

954
01:33:41,705 --> 01:33:43,123
You unexist.

955
01:33:47,168 --> 01:33:48,295
Get up.

956
01:34:06,980 --> 01:34:08,273
Come here.

957
01:34:26,207 --> 01:34:27,542
Look at you.

958
01:34:29,044 --> 01:34:30,795
You're rotting away.

959
01:34:43,600 --> 01:34:45,352
That is the last man.

960
01:34:46,770 --> 01:34:49,606
If you are human, that is humanity.

961
01:34:51,566 --> 01:34:53,568
It will not last forever.

962
01:34:54,944 --> 01:34:57,822
You can escape from it
whenever you choose.

963
01:34:58,740 --> 01:35:00,575
Everything depends on you.

964
01:35:00,700 --> 01:35:02,077
You did it.

965
01:35:03,286 --> 01:35:05,664
You reduced me to this.

966
01:35:06,164 --> 01:35:07,582
No, Winston.

967
01:35:08,750 --> 01:35:10,835
You reduced yourself to it.

968
01:35:12,212 --> 01:35:14,089
When will you shoot me?

969
01:35:16,758 --> 01:35:18,593
Might take a long time.

970
01:35:19,886 --> 01:35:21,805
But don't give up hope.

971
01:35:22,597 --> 01:35:25,016
Everyone is cured sooner or later.

972
01:35:27,352 --> 01:35:28,937
And in the end...

973
01:35:30,480 --> 01:35:32,190
we shall shoot you.

974
01:35:33,066 --> 01:35:35,276
The law of gravity is nonsense.

975
01:35:36,277 --> 01:35:37,946
No such law exists.

976
01:35:38,613 --> 01:35:40,448
If I think I float...

977
01:35:41,116 --> 01:35:43,118
and you think I float...

978
01:35:43,618 --> 01:35:45,161
then it happens.

979
01:35:45,453 --> 01:35:46,788
I love you.

980
01:35:47,038 --> 01:35:50,542
You have the strength, Winston.
You have the whole Party.

981
01:35:51,084 --> 01:35:52,711
You are the Party.

982
01:35:53,044 --> 01:35:55,922
You're one of us, one of the chosen.

983
01:35:56,631 --> 01:35:58,008
I love you.

984
01:35:58,967 --> 01:36:00,552
I love you, too.

985
01:36:09,519 --> 01:36:10,812
Julia, my love.

986
01:36:22,490 --> 01:36:23,616
Get up.

987
01:36:30,332 --> 01:36:32,083
Stand up straighter.

988
01:36:33,501 --> 01:36:35,295
Look me in the face.

989
01:36:39,591 --> 01:36:43,511
Tell me, Winston, and remember, no lies.

990
01:36:45,639 --> 01:36:48,767
What are your true feelings
towards Big Brother?

991
01:36:50,018 --> 01:36:52,479
- I hate him.
- You must love him.

992
01:36:54,064 --> 01:36:56,149
It's not enough to obey him.

993
01:36:57,025 --> 01:36:58,652
You must love him.

994
01:37:00,820 --> 01:37:02,072
Room 101.

995
01:37:29,557 --> 01:37:32,727
You asked me once, Winston,
what was in Room 101.

996
01:37:33,853 --> 01:37:37,565
I told you that you knew, already.
Everyone knows.

997
01:37:40,902 --> 01:37:43,238
The thing that is in Room 101...

998
01:37:44,406 --> 01:37:46,741
is the worst thing in the world.

999
01:37:57,961 --> 01:38:00,547
It goes beyond fear of pain or death.

1000
01:38:02,048 --> 01:38:05,844
It is unendurable,
and it varies from individual to individual.

1001
01:38:07,345 --> 01:38:11,099
It may be burial alive or castration...

1002
01:38:12,100 --> 01:38:14,019
or many other things.

1003
01:38:18,773 --> 01:38:21,234
In your case, it is rats.

1004
01:38:22,444 --> 01:38:23,445
No.

1005
01:38:28,950 --> 01:38:31,369
Please. What do you want me to do?

1006
01:38:31,745 --> 01:38:34,080
You will do what is required of you.

1007
01:38:34,372 --> 01:38:36,833
What? What is it?

1008
01:38:37,959 --> 01:38:40,837
How can I do it if I don't know what it is?

1009
01:38:42,797 --> 01:38:45,925
In the proletarian areas,
they will attack a baby...

1010
01:38:46,676 --> 01:38:49,638
and within five minutes, strip it to the bone.

1011
01:38:50,388 --> 01:38:53,141
They also attack the sick and dying.

1012
01:38:54,601 --> 01:38:59,230
They show astonishing intelligence
in knowing when a human being is helpless.

1013
01:39:07,656 --> 01:39:09,324
Please.

1014
01:39:14,287 --> 01:39:17,582
The mask fits over your head,
leaving no exit.

1015
01:39:18,875 --> 01:39:20,502
I press the first lever...

1016
01:39:20,627 --> 01:39:23,129
and the rats move into
the front compartment.

1017
01:39:24,339 --> 01:39:27,968
I press the second,
and the door of the cage will slide up.

1018
01:39:29,344 --> 01:39:32,722
These starving brutes
will shoot at you like bullets.

1019
01:39:33,181 --> 01:39:36,184
Have you ever seen a rat
leap through the air?

1020
01:39:39,980 --> 01:39:43,483
They will leap onto your face
and bore straight into it.

1021
01:39:44,359 --> 01:39:46,945
Sometimes they attack the eyes first.

1022
01:39:49,322 --> 01:39:53,159
Sometimes they burrow through the cheeks
and devour the tongue.

1023
01:39:58,206 --> 01:40:01,918
Tell me. What do you want?

1024
01:40:07,841 --> 01:40:09,217
No, please.

1025
01:40:17,350 --> 01:40:18,935
I love you.

1026
01:40:20,979 --> 01:40:24,024
Do it to her! Do it to Julia!

1027
01:40:24,524 --> 01:40:26,985
I don't care what you do to her,
but do it to her!

1028
01:40:27,068 --> 01:40:30,113
Tear her my face off!
Do it to Julia, not to me!

1029
01:40:31,740 --> 01:40:33,742
Do it to Julia!

1030
01:40:37,662 --> 01:40:38,872
Not me!

1031
01:40:43,376 --> 01:40:47,297
A vast military buildup has been reported
in the Sahara Desert...

1032
01:40:47,422 --> 01:40:49,841
in Sectors 17 and 18 of the war zones.

1033
01:40:51,217 --> 01:40:53,720
That is the end of the announcement.

1034
01:41:32,968 --> 01:41:34,177
Brother.

1035
01:41:43,103 --> 01:41:44,521
On the house.

1036
01:41:52,320 --> 01:41:54,114
Thank you for coming.

1037
01:41:58,159 --> 01:42:02,205
You are warned to stand by
for an important announcement at 15... 30.

1038
01:42:02,664 --> 01:42:05,166
This is news of
the gravest national consequence...

1039
01:42:05,250 --> 01:42:07,168
concerning the war with Eurasia.

1040
01:42:07,294 --> 01:42:08,461
15... 30.

1041
01:42:10,380 --> 01:42:13,049
Are you worried about the African front?

1042
01:42:15,218 --> 01:42:19,764
The news is disquieting in the extreme.
I've been worrying about it all day.

1043
01:42:20,598 --> 01:42:23,101
It's not just a question of losing Africa.

1044
01:42:23,184 --> 01:42:27,897
For the first time, the territory of Oceania
itself is threatened by invasion.

1045
01:42:28,148 --> 01:42:29,816
It's inconceivable.

1046
01:42:37,782 --> 01:42:41,036
It must have been possible
to outflank them in some way.

1047
01:42:48,501 --> 01:42:50,170
I have an instinct.

1048
01:42:52,047 --> 01:42:53,673
There's bad news on the way.

1049
01:42:59,554 --> 01:43:01,514
I told them all about you.

1050
01:43:04,893 --> 01:43:08,229
I'm only thankful they got me
before it was too late.

1051
01:43:08,605 --> 01:43:10,899
Yes, I told them about you, too.

1052
01:43:11,983 --> 01:43:13,485
Thoughtcrime...

1053
01:43:15,945 --> 01:43:17,906
sexcrime, all your treachery.

1054
01:43:26,915 --> 01:43:28,875
I have a meeting to go to.

1055
01:43:32,921 --> 01:43:34,422
We must meet again.

1056
01:43:37,258 --> 01:43:38,301
Yes.

1057
01:43:41,388 --> 01:43:43,098
We must meet again.

1058
01:44:00,782 --> 01:44:03,493
I accuse myself of the following crimes...

1059
01:44:04,536 --> 01:44:07,330
I have seduced Party members
of both sexes...

1060
01:44:07,914 --> 01:44:10,458
I've been to the proletarian areas...

1061
01:44:10,917 --> 01:44:14,504
I deliberately contracted syphilis
in order to spread the disease...

1062
01:44:14,629 --> 01:44:17,090
to my wife and other Party members.

1063
01:44:17,716 --> 01:44:21,469
Together with other agents,
I have counterfeited banknotes...

1064
01:44:22,304 --> 01:44:26,683
wrecked industrial machinery,
polluted the water supply...

1065
01:44:27,600 --> 01:44:30,520
guided Eurasian rocket bombs
to targets on Airstrip One...

1066
01:44:30,645 --> 01:44:32,981
by means of coded radio signals.

1067
01:44:34,899 --> 01:44:38,695
I stand here, a victim of the influence
of Emmanuel Goldstein.

1068
01:44:39,612 --> 01:44:41,489
Guilty on all counts.

1069
01:44:43,283 --> 01:44:46,369
I'm glad I was caught.
I was mentally deranged.

1070
01:44:47,787 --> 01:44:49,247
Now I am cured.

1071
01:44:50,874 --> 01:44:55,337
I ask only for you to accept
my love of our leader.

1072
01:44:56,755 --> 01:45:00,967
I ask only to be shot
while my mind is still clean.

1073
01:45:13,521 --> 01:45:15,190
A glorious victory!

1074
01:45:15,440 --> 01:45:17,984
A vast, strategic maneuver to outflank...

1075
01:45:18,068 --> 01:45:21,863
the Eurasian Forces on the African front
has been successful.

1076
01:45:22,906 --> 01:45:27,869
Perfectly coordinated, it has resulted
in the utter rout of the Eurasian Army.

1077
01:45:28,745 --> 01:45:33,541
There have been nearly a million prisoners.
It has been an utter rout.

1078
01:45:34,542 --> 01:45:35,710
Waiter?

1079
01:45:38,171 --> 01:45:42,634
This immense victory brings the war
within measurable distance of its end.

1080
01:45:44,678 --> 01:45:46,179
Wonderful news.

1081
01:46:43,820 --> 01:46:45,113
I love you.
