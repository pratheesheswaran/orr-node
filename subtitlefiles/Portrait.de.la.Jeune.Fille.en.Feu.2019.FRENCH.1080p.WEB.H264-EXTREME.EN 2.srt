1
00:01:11,618 --> 00:01:12,933
First, my contours.

2
00:01:16,541 --> 00:01:17,702
The outline.

3
00:01:25,786 --> 00:01:26,937
Not too fast.

4
00:01:33,700 --> 00:01:35,176
Take time to look at me.

5
00:01:43,869 --> 00:01:45,688
See how my arms are placed.

6
00:01:48,791 --> 00:01:49,716
My hands.

7
00:01:59,918 --> 00:02:01,288
Who brought that painting out?

8
00:02:10,911 --> 00:02:12,777
From the stock.
I shouldn't have?

9
00:02:13,269 --> 00:02:14,023
No.

10
00:02:19,258 --> 00:02:20,366
Did you paint it?

11
00:02:23,749 --> 00:02:24,352
Yes.

12
00:02:30,134 --> 00:02:31,142
A long time ago.

13
00:02:35,754 --> 00:02:36,826
What's the title?

14
00:02:40,714 --> 00:02:42,439
<i>Portrait of a Lady on Fire.</i>

15
00:04:52,739 --> 00:04:54,041
Where do I go?

16
00:04:56,307 --> 00:04:58,084
Head straight up to the trees.

17
00:05:50,380 --> 00:05:51,460
I'm Marianne.

18
00:07:01,468 --> 00:07:02,952
It was a reception room.

19
00:07:03,527 --> 00:07:04,960
I've never seen it used.

20
00:07:06,587 --> 00:07:08,230
Have you been here long?

21
00:07:08,397 --> 00:07:09,460
Three years.

22
00:07:13,676 --> 00:07:14,999
Do you like it here?

23
00:07:15,596 --> 00:07:16,480
Yes.

24
00:07:22,201 --> 00:07:23,542
I'll let you get dry.

25
00:10:17,718 --> 00:10:18,965
Sorry, I helped myself.

26
00:10:19,944 --> 00:10:20,886
I was hungry.

27
00:10:24,053 --> 00:10:25,156
Is there any wine?

28
00:10:25,565 --> 00:10:26,399
Yes.

29
00:10:46,151 --> 00:10:47,460
May I be curious?

30
00:10:57,685 --> 00:10:59,010
What is your young mistress like?

31
00:11:01,027 --> 00:11:02,440
I don't know her well.

32
00:11:05,343 --> 00:11:06,780
You've been here three years.

33
00:11:07,931 --> 00:11:09,526
She only arrived a few weeks ago.

34
00:11:11,811 --> 00:11:13,018
Where from?

35
00:11:14,843 --> 00:11:16,049
The Benedictines.

36
00:11:17,849 --> 00:11:19,373
Has she left holy orders?

37
00:11:22,057 --> 00:11:23,406
They brought her home.

38
00:11:27,834 --> 00:11:29,144
Her sister died.

39
00:11:30,993 --> 00:11:32,564
She was the only one due to marry?

40
00:11:39,819 --> 00:11:41,136
Did disease take her?

41
00:11:43,723 --> 00:11:44,636
No.

42
00:11:50,008 --> 00:11:51,421
Will you manage it?

43
00:11:54,393 --> 00:11:55,417
Manage what?

44
00:11:57,052 --> 00:11:58,013
To paint her.

45
00:11:59,052 --> 00:12:00,156
Why do you ask?

46
00:12:01,116 --> 00:12:02,457
Another painter was here.

47
00:12:05,495 --> 00:12:06,750
He wasn't able to.

48
00:12:08,202 --> 00:12:09,408
What happened?

49
00:12:14,445 --> 00:12:15,556
I don't know.

50
00:14:09,233 --> 00:14:11,175
I'm afraid it's the only one.

51
00:14:17,607 --> 00:14:20,814
She has no dresses yet
and wears her convent clothes.

52
00:14:23,427 --> 00:14:24,752
She has blond hair?

53
00:14:24,943 --> 00:14:25,594
Yes.

54
00:14:30,588 --> 00:14:31,691
This will do.

55
00:14:41,291 --> 00:14:42,974
Do you recognize it?

56
00:14:45,124 --> 00:14:46,521
My father painted it.

57
00:14:50,064 --> 00:14:51,191
One of his first.

58
00:14:52,254 --> 00:14:55,049
It was in Milan, before my marriage.

59
00:15:02,406 --> 00:15:04,883
My daughter's suitor is Milanese.

60
00:15:05,145 --> 00:15:07,701
We'll go there if he likes the portrait.

61
00:15:07,995 --> 00:15:08,987
You'll leave.

62
00:15:10,398 --> 00:15:12,081
I have to tell you...

63
00:15:13,764 --> 00:15:15,946
She wore out one painter before you.

64
00:15:16,862 --> 00:15:20,362
In a very simple manner:
she refused to pose.

65
00:15:21,545 --> 00:15:23,125
He never saw her face.

66
00:15:23,125 --> 00:15:24,665
Why won't she be painted?

67
00:15:25,787 --> 00:15:27,335
She refuses this marriage.

68
00:15:32,629 --> 00:15:34,891
You must paint her without her knowing.

69
00:15:36,417 --> 00:15:39,473
She thinks you're a companion
for walks.

70
00:15:40,616 --> 00:15:41,823
She's delighted.

71
00:15:42,450 --> 00:15:44,965
Since she arrived, I don't let her out.

72
00:15:45,989 --> 00:15:46,838
Why not?

73
00:15:49,950 --> 00:15:52,156
I wasn't wary enough with her sister.

74
00:15:56,188 --> 00:15:58,021
She thinks I'll watch over her.

75
00:15:59,406 --> 00:16:01,366
And you, observe her.

76
00:16:03,578 --> 00:16:06,173
Is painting her that way feasible?

77
00:16:06,563 --> 00:16:08,483
More than being a companion.

78
00:16:11,927 --> 00:16:14,022
The portrait arrived here before me.

79
00:16:18,179 --> 00:16:20,599
When I first entered this room,

80
00:16:20,742 --> 00:16:24,129
I found myself facing my image
hanging on the wall.

81
00:16:25,724 --> 00:16:26,883
She was waiting for me.

82
00:17:58,952 --> 00:18:00,500
She's waiting to go out.

83
00:18:01,567 --> 00:18:02,503
Come in.

84
00:18:06,039 --> 00:18:08,848
Tell me, what happened to your mistress?

85
00:18:09,523 --> 00:18:10,801
How did she die?

86
00:18:13,578 --> 00:18:15,213
We were walking by the cliffs.

87
00:18:16,078 --> 00:18:17,665
She was behind me and vanished.

88
00:18:18,727 --> 00:18:20,441
I saw her broken body below.

89
00:18:23,212 --> 00:18:24,519
Did you see her fall?

90
00:18:24,667 --> 00:18:25,661
No.

91
00:18:25,922 --> 00:18:27,120
I think she jumped.

92
00:18:29,818 --> 00:18:31,033
Why do you think that?

93
00:18:34,482 --> 00:18:35,665
She didn't cry out.

94
00:19:59,402 --> 00:20:01,069
I've dreamt of that for years.

95
00:20:03,394 --> 00:20:04,434
Dying?

96
00:20:05,631 --> 00:20:06,575
Running.

97
00:21:16,674 --> 00:21:20,293
<i>One must show the ear
and study its cartilage closely,</i>

98
00:21:21,071 --> 00:21:23,166
<i>even if covered with hair.</i>

99
00:21:24,233 --> 00:21:27,361
<i>It must be
of a warm and transparent hue,</i>

100
00:21:28,255 --> 00:21:30,604
<i>except for the hole,
which is always strong.</i>

101
00:21:32,049 --> 00:21:35,769
<i>Its tone, even in light,
must yield to the cheek,</i>

102
00:21:37,401 --> 00:21:39,004
<i>which is more prominent.</i>

103
00:21:41,556 --> 00:21:42,890
Did you bring a book?

104
00:21:44,461 --> 00:21:45,414
Yes.

105
00:21:46,899 --> 00:21:48,201
May I borrow it?

106
00:21:49,952 --> 00:21:51,253
I'll fetch it.

107
00:22:32,648 --> 00:22:33,719
Thank you.

108
00:22:35,244 --> 00:22:36,887
It's odd you sleep here.

109
00:24:52,080 --> 00:24:53,247
Miss...

110
00:24:54,184 --> 00:24:55,271
Miss!

111
00:24:58,448 --> 00:24:59,512
She's waiting.

112
00:25:14,985 --> 00:25:16,168
Is she downstairs?

113
00:25:17,168 --> 00:25:18,295
I must cover you up.

114
00:25:19,009 --> 00:25:19,803
It's windy.

115
00:26:50,606 --> 00:26:51,956
I'd like to bathe.

116
00:26:59,443 --> 00:27:00,848
On a calmer day.

117
00:27:01,417 --> 00:27:02,179
Yes.

118
00:27:06,695 --> 00:27:08,021
How long will you stay?

119
00:27:08,866 --> 00:27:09,851
Six more days.

120
00:27:16,855 --> 00:27:17,982
Do you swim?

121
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:24,112
I don't know.

122
00:27:26,619 --> 00:27:28,286
It's too dangerous if you don't.

123
00:27:30,112 --> 00:27:31,937
I meant, I don't know if I can swim.

124
00:28:28,506 --> 00:28:29,943
How was your day?

125
00:28:31,522 --> 00:28:32,522
Difficult.

126
00:28:38,238 --> 00:28:40,143
She always stays ahead of me

127
00:28:41,008 --> 00:28:42,992
and walks alone on the beach.

128
00:28:46,411 --> 00:28:47,974
Have you started painting?

129
00:28:49,514 --> 00:28:50,490
Not yet.

130
00:28:52,153 --> 00:28:53,772
I haven't even seen her smile.

131
00:28:55,669 --> 00:28:57,138
Have you tried to be funny?

132
00:30:11,171 --> 00:30:12,497
Is it unfinished?

133
00:30:15,361 --> 00:30:16,671
My sister was embroidering it.

134
00:30:19,227 --> 00:30:20,640
Do you think she wanted to die?

135
00:30:25,231 --> 00:30:28,184
You're the first person
unafraid to ask that.

136
00:30:29,713 --> 00:30:31,007
Apart from you?

137
00:30:33,460 --> 00:30:35,452
Not out loud. But yes.

138
00:30:40,423 --> 00:30:42,431
In her last letter, she apologized.

139
00:30:42,812 --> 00:30:43,939
For no reason.

140
00:30:46,084 --> 00:30:47,593
What could she be apologizing for?

141
00:30:52,115 --> 00:30:53,607
For leaving me her fate.

142
00:30:55,606 --> 00:30:57,384
You make it sound terrible.

143
00:31:03,009 --> 00:31:04,636
What do you know of my marriage?

144
00:31:07,436 --> 00:31:09,848
You're to wed
a Milanese gentleman, that's all.

145
00:31:11,721 --> 00:31:13,206
That's all I know too.

146
00:31:13,926 --> 00:31:15,386
You see why it worries me.

147
00:31:18,894 --> 00:31:20,204
Put that way, yes.

148
00:31:21,667 --> 00:31:22,968
I put it the way it is.

149
00:31:26,724 --> 00:31:28,224
You'd rather have stayed
in the convent?

150
00:31:29,376 --> 00:31:31,083
It's a life that has advantages.

151
00:31:31,598 --> 00:31:32,797
There's a library.

152
00:31:33,289 --> 00:31:35,138
You can sing or hear music.

153
00:31:40,653 --> 00:31:42,773
And equality is a pleasant feeling.

154
00:31:46,923 --> 00:31:48,582
I found the convent unjust.

155
00:31:49,634 --> 00:31:51,457
I left after my fist communion.

156
00:31:52,150 --> 00:31:54,983
They punished me
for drawing in my notebooks' margins.

157
00:31:55,858 --> 00:31:56,763
You draw?

158
00:31:58,231 --> 00:31:59,818
Yes. A little.

159
00:32:08,738 --> 00:32:10,984
What about you?
When will you marry?

160
00:32:14,506 --> 00:32:16,046
I don't know if I will.

161
00:32:16,843 --> 00:32:18,462
- You don't have to?
- No.

162
00:32:20,248 --> 00:32:23,106
I'll take over my father's business.

163
00:32:33,556 --> 00:32:36,318
You can choose.
That's why you don't understand me.

164
00:32:41,021 --> 00:32:42,180
I understand you.

165
00:32:45,906 --> 00:32:47,518
How are your days?

166
00:32:48,509 --> 00:32:51,096
We return late
and I have little light to work.

167
00:32:53,332 --> 00:32:55,784
I'll keep her here tomorrow afternoon.

168
00:32:56,133 --> 00:32:58,363
You'll be free to make progress.

169
00:33:00,228 --> 00:33:02,862
Perhaps you could allow her
to go out alone.

170
00:33:05,327 --> 00:33:08,193
Fear not. She isn't sad, but angry.

171
00:33:10,455 --> 00:33:12,313
You think I don't know her anger?

172
00:33:14,694 --> 00:33:15,725
I know it well.

173
00:33:16,834 --> 00:33:18,207
Yes, I know it too.

174
00:33:21,770 --> 00:33:23,254
Where did you learn Italian?

175
00:33:24,105 --> 00:33:24,899
In Milan.

176
00:33:25,953 --> 00:33:27,255
You know Milan?

177
00:33:27,961 --> 00:33:29,580
I can't wait to go back.

178
00:33:30,271 --> 00:33:32,517
I haven't gone back in 20 years.

179
00:33:33,410 --> 00:33:35,346
Tell her Milan is beautiful.

180
00:33:35,997 --> 00:33:37,545
And that life will be sweeter.

181
00:33:38,908 --> 00:33:40,225
She doesn't talk much to me.

182
00:33:41,990 --> 00:33:44,387
I'm not marrying her
to the local gentry.

183
00:33:45,070 --> 00:33:46,434
I'm trying

184
00:33:46,942 --> 00:33:48,455
to take her elsewhere.

185
00:33:49,130 --> 00:33:51,130
She'll be less bored there.

186
00:33:51,983 --> 00:33:53,189
And you too.

187
00:33:53,553 --> 00:33:54,620
Indeed. Why not?

188
00:33:58,580 --> 00:34:01,254
I'll leave for the coast
at the same time as you.

189
00:34:02,260 --> 00:34:04,474
If you don't have to return to Paris,

190
00:34:05,474 --> 00:34:08,038
I have a friend
who'd like her portrait done.

191
00:34:09,919 --> 00:34:10,634
Thank you.

192
00:34:11,800 --> 00:34:13,046
It won't be easy.

193
00:34:14,451 --> 00:34:17,141
My friend is particularly ugly.

194
00:34:20,230 --> 00:34:21,436
She's very ugly.

195
00:34:29,806 --> 00:34:31,155
You've made me laugh.

196
00:34:33,338 --> 00:34:35,084
It's ages since that happened.

197
00:34:36,536 --> 00:34:37,806
I didn't do anything.

198
00:34:39,098 --> 00:34:39,959
You're here.

199
00:34:41,133 --> 00:34:42,953
It takes two to be funny.

200
00:35:34,820 --> 00:35:35,892
Marianne?

201
00:36:21,387 --> 00:36:22,490
Do you have tobacco?

202
00:36:24,077 --> 00:36:24,839
Yes.

203
00:36:52,176 --> 00:36:54,271
Your mother will let you
go out alone tomorrow.

204
00:36:56,066 --> 00:36:57,057
You'll be free.

205
00:37:00,248 --> 00:37:01,685
Being free is being alone?

206
00:37:04,117 --> 00:37:05,157
You don't think so?

207
00:37:06,101 --> 00:37:07,268
I'll tell you tomorrow.

208
00:37:14,092 --> 00:37:15,331
I'll go to mass.

209
00:37:16,750 --> 00:37:18,121
To receive Communion?

210
00:37:18,927 --> 00:37:20,260
I want to hear music.

211
00:37:21,711 --> 00:37:23,623
Organ music is pretty but bleak.

212
00:37:24,298 --> 00:37:25,481
It's all I know.

213
00:37:26,777 --> 00:37:28,349
You've never heard an orchestra?

214
00:37:28,747 --> 00:37:29,430
No.

215
00:37:31,103 --> 00:37:31,952
Have you?

216
00:37:36,777 --> 00:37:37,817
Tell me about it.

217
00:37:43,297 --> 00:37:45,074
It's not easy to relate music.

218
00:38:34,952 --> 00:38:35,873
What is it?

219
00:38:37,236 --> 00:38:38,411
A piece that I love.

220
00:38:44,349 --> 00:38:45,485
Is it merry?

221
00:38:47,421 --> 00:38:49,485
Not merry, but it's lively.

222
00:39:05,302 --> 00:39:07,111
It's about a coming storm.

223
00:39:12,933 --> 00:39:14,250
The insects sense it.

224
00:39:19,263 --> 00:39:20,517
They become agitated.

225
00:39:20,929 --> 00:39:22,359
Then the storm breaks.

226
00:39:24,790 --> 00:39:26,425
With lightning and the wind.

227
00:39:37,751 --> 00:39:39,243
I can't remember it...

228
00:39:45,869 --> 00:39:48,615
You'll hear the rest.
Milan is a city of music.

229
00:39:53,448 --> 00:39:54,836
Then I can't wait for Milan.

230
00:39:59,806 --> 00:40:01,719
I'm saying there will be good things.

231
00:40:05,978 --> 00:40:08,026
You're saying that, now and then,

232
00:40:09,462 --> 00:40:10,875
I'll be consoled.

233
00:41:57,285 --> 00:41:58,913
How was mass?

234
00:42:01,767 --> 00:42:03,236
You look cheerful.

235
00:42:03,434 --> 00:42:04,712
I sang a lot.

236
00:42:06,110 --> 00:42:07,531
Are you leaving me already?

237
00:42:07,911 --> 00:42:09,030
Yes.

238
00:42:09,348 --> 00:42:10,951
Will you come out tomorrow?

239
00:42:12,959 --> 00:42:14,149
Yes.

240
00:42:15,924 --> 00:42:18,464
In solitude,
I felt the liberty you spoke of.

241
00:42:22,735 --> 00:42:24,767
But I also felt your absence.

242
00:42:59,807 --> 00:43:01,053
The portrait is finished.

243
00:43:03,897 --> 00:43:05,206
Are you happy with it?

244
00:43:07,307 --> 00:43:08,593
I think so.

245
00:43:10,824 --> 00:43:12,228
Let's go to see it.

246
00:43:20,160 --> 00:43:21,700
May I ask a favour?

247
00:43:25,914 --> 00:43:26,764
Go on.

248
00:43:31,186 --> 00:43:32,935
I'd like to show her first.

249
00:43:35,017 --> 00:43:36,567
And tell her the truth myself.

250
00:43:41,034 --> 00:43:42,026
I understand.

251
00:43:43,565 --> 00:43:44,756
She's very fond of you.

252
00:43:48,333 --> 00:43:49,341
How do you know?

253
00:43:53,974 --> 00:43:55,704
She talks about you.

254
00:45:52,180 --> 00:45:52,934
Héloïse...

255
00:45:55,974 --> 00:45:57,379
I must tell you something.

256
00:46:00,181 --> 00:46:01,300
I'm a painter.

257
00:46:02,436 --> 00:46:03,698
I came here to paint you.

258
00:46:07,791 --> 00:46:09,441
I've finished your portrait.

259
00:46:18,819 --> 00:46:21,327
I see now why you praised
the charms of exile.

260
00:46:23,100 --> 00:46:24,378
You felt guilty.

261
00:46:35,427 --> 00:46:36,736
Are you leaving?

262
00:46:37,700 --> 00:46:39,795
Later today. With your mother.

263
00:46:49,772 --> 00:46:51,304
Then I shall bathe today.

264
00:48:13,953 --> 00:48:15,723
Well, can you swim?

265
00:48:16,843 --> 00:48:18,364
I still don't know if I can.

266
00:48:19,706 --> 00:48:20,706
Did you see me?

267
00:48:21,936 --> 00:48:23,245
You can float.

268
00:48:33,150 --> 00:48:34,372
Let's go back.

269
00:48:44,372 --> 00:48:45,689
It explains all your looks.

270
00:49:13,080 --> 00:49:14,286
You're saying nothing?

271
00:49:19,438 --> 00:49:20,390
Is that me?

272
00:49:23,125 --> 00:49:23,855
Yes.

273
00:49:26,911 --> 00:49:28,220
Is that how you see me?

274
00:49:33,798 --> 00:49:35,211
It's not only me.

275
00:49:37,102 --> 00:49:38,617
What do you mean, not only you?

276
00:49:41,689 --> 00:49:44,769
There are rules, conventions, ideas.

277
00:49:49,834 --> 00:49:51,365
You mean there's no life?

278
00:49:52,825 --> 00:49:53,877
No presence?

279
00:49:55,460 --> 00:49:59,476
Your presence is made up
of fleeting moments that may lack truth.

280
00:50:02,044 --> 00:50:03,378
Not everything is fleeting.

281
00:50:06,522 --> 00:50:08,125
Some feelings are deep.

282
00:50:12,704 --> 00:50:14,315
The fact it isn't close to me,

283
00:50:15,572 --> 00:50:16,874
that I can understand.

284
00:50:20,070 --> 00:50:22,721
But I find it sad
it isn't close to you.

285
00:50:23,665 --> 00:50:26,396
How do you know
it isn't close to me?

286
00:50:28,490 --> 00:50:30,307
I didn't know you were an art critic.

287
00:50:31,688 --> 00:50:33,116
I didn't know you were a painter.

288
00:50:40,028 --> 00:50:41,393
I'll fetch my mother.

289
00:51:25,764 --> 00:51:28,113
It wasn't good enough. I'll start again.

290
00:51:30,631 --> 00:51:31,733
You're joking.

291
00:51:34,397 --> 00:51:35,318
I'm sorry.

292
00:51:36,722 --> 00:51:38,023
It wasn't satisfactory.

293
00:51:38,687 --> 00:51:40,084
You're incompetent then.

294
00:51:40,641 --> 00:51:41,744
You can leave.

295
00:51:43,033 --> 00:51:44,129
She's staying.

296
00:51:47,002 --> 00:51:48,319
I'll pose for her.

297
00:51:50,372 --> 00:51:51,205
Really?

298
00:51:53,276 --> 00:51:54,078
Yes.

299
00:52:03,984 --> 00:52:04,769
Why?

300
00:52:09,328 --> 00:52:10,638
What does it change for you?

301
00:52:15,705 --> 00:52:16,649
Nothing.

302
00:52:21,462 --> 00:52:22,890
I'll be away five days.

303
00:52:23,454 --> 00:52:25,399
When I return, it will be finished.

304
00:52:26,958 --> 00:52:28,395
And I decide, not you.

305
00:52:29,982 --> 00:52:30,903
Understood?

306
00:52:37,206 --> 00:52:39,269
Say goodbye like when you were little.

307
00:53:14,707 --> 00:53:16,008
Sit down.

308
00:53:27,438 --> 00:53:29,018
Turn your chest towards me.

309
00:53:31,614 --> 00:53:32,669
A little more.

310
00:53:36,733 --> 00:53:38,082
Turn your head slightly.

311
00:53:51,546 --> 00:53:52,744
Rest your arm here.

312
00:53:54,785 --> 00:53:56,642
Not like that. May I?

313
00:53:59,735 --> 00:54:01,140
Take your hand.

314
00:54:02,334 --> 00:54:03,461
The other way.

315
00:54:04,701 --> 00:54:05,472
Like this.

316
00:54:16,365 --> 00:54:18,064
- Are you comfortable?
- Yes.

317
00:54:18,929 --> 00:54:20,683
Can you hold this position?

318
00:54:20,896 --> 00:54:21,769
Yes.

319
00:54:28,609 --> 00:54:29,759
Look at me.

320
00:55:45,026 --> 00:55:46,518
The heat will do you good.

321
00:55:47,517 --> 00:55:48,922
The cherrystones hold it in.

322
00:56:03,190 --> 00:56:04,238
Thank you.

323
00:56:10,231 --> 00:56:12,056
I usually have one ready,

324
00:56:12,784 --> 00:56:14,221
but I haven't had my monthlies.

325
00:56:18,293 --> 00:56:19,523
More than once?

326
00:56:20,411 --> 00:56:21,602
Three times.

327
00:56:25,420 --> 00:56:26,999
Is this the first time?

328
00:56:27,301 --> 00:56:28,015
Yes.

329
00:56:31,170 --> 00:56:32,667
Do you want a child?

330
00:56:32,859 --> 00:56:33,732
No.

331
00:56:34,632 --> 00:56:37,771
I was waiting for Madam to leave
to see to it.

332
00:57:01,829 --> 00:57:02,641
I can't.

333
00:57:02,798 --> 00:57:03,827
A little more.

334
00:57:23,355 --> 00:57:24,401
I can't go on.

335
00:58:03,579 --> 00:58:04,380
No.

336
00:58:05,821 --> 00:58:07,438
It mustn't be in flower.

337
00:58:36,535 --> 00:58:37,559
It's ready.

338
00:59:03,265 --> 00:59:04,672
Will it be enough?

339
00:59:04,838 --> 00:59:05,913
We'll see.

340
00:59:31,878 --> 00:59:33,323
Has it happened to you?

341
00:59:38,592 --> 00:59:39,560
Yes.

342
00:59:42,582 --> 00:59:43,960
You've known love.

343
00:59:47,518 --> 00:59:48,233
Yes.

344
00:59:51,132 --> 00:59:52,023
What is it like?

345
00:59:54,971 --> 00:59:56,438
It's hard to say.

346
00:59:58,066 --> 00:59:59,645
I mean, how does it feel?

347
01:03:43,885 --> 01:03:45,440
I can't make you smile.

348
01:03:47,507 --> 01:03:50,102
I feel I do it
and then it vanishes.

349
01:03:54,198 --> 01:03:55,706
Anger always comes to the fore.

350
01:03:56,579 --> 01:03:57,884
Definitely with you.

351
01:04:03,102 --> 01:04:04,428
I didn't mean to hurt you.

352
01:04:05,898 --> 01:04:07,015
You haven't hurt me.

353
01:04:07,598 --> 01:04:08,825
I have, I can tell.

354
01:04:09,142 --> 01:04:11,507
When you're moved,
you do this with your hand.

355
01:04:13,367 --> 01:04:14,219
Really?

356
01:04:14,609 --> 01:04:15,242
Yes.

357
01:04:19,042 --> 01:04:20,809
And when you're embarrassed,

358
01:04:22,812 --> 01:04:24,062
you bite your lips.

359
01:04:28,700 --> 01:04:30,404
And when you're annoyed,

360
01:04:32,918 --> 01:04:34,074
you don't blink.

361
01:04:34,972 --> 01:04:35,980
You know it all.

362
01:04:37,699 --> 01:04:39,823
Forgive me,
I'd hate to be in your place.

363
01:04:42,387 --> 01:04:43,895
We're in the same place.

364
01:04:44,958 --> 01:04:46,215
Exactly the same place.

365
01:04:48,617 --> 01:04:49,531
Come here.

366
01:04:52,172 --> 01:04:52,812
Come.

367
01:05:02,241 --> 01:05:03,116
Step closer.

368
01:05:10,364 --> 01:05:11,101
Look.

369
01:05:14,623 --> 01:05:15,826
If you look at me,

370
01:05:16,818 --> 01:05:17,927
who do I look at?

371
01:05:22,986 --> 01:05:25,737
When you don't know what to say,
you touch your forehead.

372
01:05:30,780 --> 01:05:33,301
When you lose control,
you raise your eyebrows.

373
01:05:41,046 --> 01:05:42,327
And when you're troubled,

374
01:05:43,827 --> 01:05:45,109
you breathe through your mouth.

375
01:06:40,492 --> 01:06:43,087
- I didn't touch!
- I win.

376
01:06:43,244 --> 01:06:44,471
I win.

377
01:06:44,844 --> 01:06:45,835
You touched it.

378
01:06:46,217 --> 01:06:47,695
Try to concentrate.

379
01:06:50,421 --> 01:06:51,620
Your turn.

380
01:06:57,506 --> 01:06:58,550
You're cheating.

381
01:06:58,741 --> 01:07:00,851
I'm not cheating, I play fast.

382
01:07:04,446 --> 01:07:05,452
Go on.

383
01:07:05,643 --> 01:07:06,390
Two.

384
01:07:07,258 --> 01:07:08,665
- Two cards.
- Two.

385
01:07:08,862 --> 01:07:09,923
Two sixes.

386
01:07:10,542 --> 01:07:12,323
- I win.
- You win, yes.

387
01:07:19,124 --> 01:07:19,987
Your turn.

388
01:07:20,742 --> 01:07:22,042
No, go on.

389
01:07:22,993 --> 01:07:23,860
Go on.

390
01:07:43,233 --> 01:07:44,725
Uncover your throat.

391
01:07:51,549 --> 01:07:52,507
More.

392
01:07:59,289 --> 01:08:01,706
You have my future husband in mind.

393
01:08:09,347 --> 01:08:11,209
Do you paint nude models too?

394
01:08:12,896 --> 01:08:14,506
Women, yes.

395
01:08:14,893 --> 01:08:16,499
Why not men?

396
01:08:18,556 --> 01:08:20,019
I'm not allowed to.

397
01:08:20,820 --> 01:08:21,595
Why not?

398
01:08:23,269 --> 01:08:24,960
Because I'm a woman.

399
01:08:30,044 --> 01:08:31,730
Is it a matter of modesty?

400
01:08:34,962 --> 01:08:38,082
It's mostly to prevent us
from doing great art.

401
01:08:40,632 --> 01:08:44,886
Without any notion of male anatomy,
the major subjects escape us.

402
01:08:45,404 --> 01:08:46,325
How do you manage?

403
01:08:47,629 --> 01:08:48,988
I do it in secret.

404
01:08:50,054 --> 01:08:51,156
It's tolerated.

405
01:08:56,309 --> 01:08:57,864
What do you tell your models

406
01:08:58,690 --> 01:08:59,801
to amuse them?

407
01:09:01,514 --> 01:09:03,185
- Are you bored?
- No.

408
01:09:03,826 --> 01:09:05,115
I'm interested in you.

409
01:09:10,573 --> 01:09:12,732
Your complexion is remarkable today.

410
01:09:18,176 --> 01:09:19,737
You're very elegant.

411
01:09:26,285 --> 01:09:27,606
You pose beautifully.

412
01:09:33,739 --> 01:09:34,832
You're pretty.

413
01:09:43,281 --> 01:09:44,624
That's what I tell them.

414
01:10:54,628 --> 01:10:58,802
<i>Then, striking the lyre
to accompany his words, he sang,</i>

415
01:10:59,157 --> 01:11:01,002
<i>'Oh, Gods of the Underworld</i>

416
01:11:01,181 --> 01:11:03,920
<i>to which all mortals descend,</i>

417
01:11:04,461 --> 01:11:06,675
<i>I am here to seek my wife.</i>

418
01:11:07,051 --> 01:11:09,596
<i>A viper that she trod on</i>

419
01:11:09,763 --> 01:11:12,589
<i>poisoned her
and robbed her of her youth.</i>

420
01:11:13,160 --> 01:11:14,484
<i>I beseech you,</i>

421
01:11:14,829 --> 01:11:18,413
<i>unravel the thread
of Eurydice's early demise.</i>

422
01:11:18,941 --> 01:11:20,447
<i>All will be yours.</i>

423
01:11:20,952 --> 01:11:22,801
<i>We all end up here.</i>

424
01:11:23,028 --> 01:11:25,178
<i>This is our final abode.</i>

425
01:11:25,344 --> 01:11:27,504
<i>You reign over the human race.</i>

426
01:11:28,561 --> 01:11:32,772
<i>After living out her fair span of years,</i>

427
01:11:33,038 --> 01:11:34,364
<i>she will be yours.</i>

428
01:11:35,312 --> 01:11:37,987
<i>If the fates refuse my wife this favour,</i>

429
01:11:38,179 --> 01:11:40,696
<i>I am determined not to return.</i>

430
01:11:41,345 --> 01:11:43,917
<i>You may delight in both our deaths'.</i>

431
01:11:44,212 --> 01:11:45,969
- He's convincing.
- Very.

432
01:11:46,171 --> 01:11:47,856
I hope they say yes.

433
01:11:53,087 --> 01:11:55,412
<i>Then, for the first time,</i>

434
01:11:55,562 --> 01:11:58,661
<i>tears wet the cheeks of the Eumenides,</i>

435
01:11:58,662 --> 01:12:00,124
<i>won over by his words.</i>

436
01:12:00,285 --> 01:12:01,692
<i>Neither the king's bride,</i>

437
01:12:01,786 --> 01:12:05,214
<i>nor the ruler of Hades
could resist his prayer.</i>

438
01:12:05,681 --> 01:12:07,174
<i>They sent for Eurydice.</i>

439
01:12:07,478 --> 01:12:10,415
<i>She was there, among the recent spirits,</i>

440
01:12:10,721 --> 01:12:13,300
<i>and approached, limping from her wound.</i>

441
01:12:13,624 --> 01:12:16,737
<i>She was returned to Orpheus on condition</i>

442
01:12:16,817 --> 01:12:19,452
<i>that he would not look back
until outside</i>

443
01:12:19,659 --> 01:12:21,420
<i>or the favour would be void.</i>

444
01:12:23,224 --> 01:12:27,689
<i>In deep silence,
they took a sloping path,</i>

445
01:12:27,983 --> 01:12:30,071
<i>steep and dark,</i>

446
01:12:30,278 --> 01:12:31,873
<i>shrouded in thick mist.</i>

447
01:12:32,533 --> 01:12:34,955
<i>They were nearing the surface,</i>

448
01:12:35,494 --> 01:12:37,930
<i>approaching the threshold, when...</i>

449
01:12:38,207 --> 01:12:41,373
<i>fearing losing Eurydice
and impatient to see her,</i>

450
01:12:41,675 --> 01:12:43,979
<i>her loving spouse turned</i>

451
01:12:44,167 --> 01:12:46,675
<i>and she was instantly drawn back.</i>

452
01:12:47,119 --> 01:12:49,345
<i>She reached out for his embrace</i>

453
01:12:49,346 --> 01:12:50,744
<i>and wished to hold him.</i>

454
01:12:51,341 --> 01:12:54,198
<i>Her poor hands
clutched only the empty air.</i>

455
01:12:55,386 --> 01:12:57,029
<i>Dying a second time,</i>

456
01:12:57,325 --> 01:12:58,864
<i>she did not complain.</i>

457
01:12:59,610 --> 01:13:02,102
<i>His sole fault was loving her.</i>

458
01:13:02,380 --> 01:13:03,531
That's horrible.

459
01:13:04,280 --> 01:13:05,978
Poor woman. Why did he turn?

460
01:13:06,456 --> 01:13:09,355
He was told not to but did,
for no reason.

461
01:13:09,356 --> 01:13:10,457
There are reasons.

462
01:13:10,586 --> 01:13:11,586
You think so?

463
01:13:12,174 --> 01:13:13,174
Read it again.

464
01:13:14,767 --> 01:13:17,833
<i>They were nearing the surface,
approaching the threshold,</i>

465
01:13:17,834 --> 01:13:21,857
<i>when, fearing losing Eurydice
and impatient to see her,</i>

466
01:13:22,283 --> 01:13:23,972
<i>her loving spouse turned.</i>

467
01:13:24,366 --> 01:13:27,824
No, he can't look at her
for fear of losing her.

468
01:13:28,077 --> 01:13:31,350
That's no reason.
He was told not to do that.

469
01:13:31,537 --> 01:13:33,913
He's madly in love. He can't resist.

470
01:13:34,637 --> 01:13:36,312
I think Sophie has a point.

471
01:13:36,824 --> 01:13:39,252
He could resist.
His reasons aren't serious.

472
01:13:39,828 --> 01:13:41,526
Perhaps he makes a choice.

473
01:13:41,883 --> 01:13:42,969
What choice?

474
01:13:43,570 --> 01:13:47,765
He chooses the memory of her.
That's why he turns.

475
01:13:50,391 --> 01:13:53,216
He doesn't make the lover's choice,
but the poet's.

476
01:14:00,257 --> 01:14:02,638
<i>She spoke a last farewell</i>

477
01:14:03,178 --> 01:14:05,567
<i>that scarcely reached his ears</i>

478
01:14:05,871 --> 01:14:07,918
<i>and fell back into the abyss.</i>

479
01:14:16,595 --> 01:14:18,421
Perhaps she was the one
who said,

480
01:14:19,671 --> 01:14:20,785
<i>Turn around.</i>

481
01:15:50,852 --> 01:15:54,582
She says I'm still pregnant
and to come back in two days.

482
01:15:55,421 --> 01:15:56,730
I'll come with you.

483
01:21:14,013 --> 01:21:15,164
What about Héloïse?

484
01:21:16,059 --> 01:21:18,267
She isn't well. She doesn't want dinner.

485
01:23:11,476 --> 01:23:13,864
I thought you had been scared off.

486
01:23:16,294 --> 01:23:17,604
You were right.

487
01:23:19,096 --> 01:23:20,293
I am scared.

488
01:23:38,924 --> 01:23:42,459
Do all lovers feel
they're inventing something?

489
01:23:47,509 --> 01:23:48,914
I know the gestures.

490
01:23:51,380 --> 01:23:53,753
I imagined it all, waiting for you.

491
01:23:54,586 --> 01:23:55,828
You dreamt of me?

492
01:23:57,856 --> 01:23:58,816
No.

493
01:23:59,967 --> 01:24:01,268
I thought of you.

494
01:24:40,587 --> 01:24:42,396
You don't want to come anymore?

495
01:24:45,243 --> 01:24:46,243
I'm coming.

496
01:24:51,726 --> 01:24:52,898
Get up.

497
01:25:37,026 --> 01:25:38,109
Wait.

498
01:25:58,310 --> 01:25:59,445
That's good.

499
01:26:10,429 --> 01:26:11,457
Lie down.

500
01:26:15,314 --> 01:26:16,647
Lift your legs.

501
01:26:18,263 --> 01:26:19,073
There.

502
01:26:24,891 --> 01:26:25,986
Thank you.

503
01:26:34,309 --> 01:26:35,776
Deep breaths.

504
01:26:50,893 --> 01:26:51,893
Look.

505
01:27:43,445 --> 01:27:44,540
Go to bed.

506
01:27:46,413 --> 01:27:47,548
I'll watch over her.

507
01:27:50,213 --> 01:27:51,693
I don't want to go to bed.

508
01:27:55,585 --> 01:27:56,640
Sophie?

509
01:27:57,823 --> 01:27:59,029
Are you asleep?

510
01:28:00,212 --> 01:28:01,309
No.

511
01:28:02,809 --> 01:28:04,209
Can you get up?

512
01:28:10,288 --> 01:28:11,309
Help her.

513
01:28:42,026 --> 01:28:43,326
Get your things.

514
01:28:43,969 --> 01:28:45,291
We're going to paint.

515
01:28:48,524 --> 01:28:49,500
Sophie...

516
01:28:49,969 --> 01:28:51,060
Come here.

517
01:28:51,886 --> 01:28:52,808
Sit down.

518
01:28:54,558 --> 01:28:55,691
Come closer.

519
01:28:58,460 --> 01:28:59,559
Lie down.

520
01:29:17,725 --> 01:29:18,827
Look at her.

521
01:29:21,163 --> 01:29:23,005
Arch your back a little.

522
01:29:27,756 --> 01:29:28,801
Sophie...

523
01:29:29,357 --> 01:29:30,675
Straighten your head.

524
01:29:34,215 --> 01:29:35,024
Yes.

525
01:30:36,863 --> 01:30:37,893
Stop that.

526
01:30:38,352 --> 01:30:39,193
What?

527
01:30:42,643 --> 01:30:43,971
What you're doing.

528
01:30:51,681 --> 01:30:52,775
Be serious.

529
01:31:03,587 --> 01:31:04,759
Keep still.

530
01:31:48,049 --> 01:31:50,256
I bought it from a woman at the feast.

531
01:31:51,053 --> 01:31:52,358
It's a plant.

532
01:31:54,469 --> 01:31:56,295
She said it makes you fly.

533
01:31:58,664 --> 01:31:59,997
Have you ever tried it?

534
01:32:00,765 --> 01:32:01,965
Never.

535
01:32:04,044 --> 01:32:05,157
Do you want to?

536
01:32:05,806 --> 01:32:06,752
Now?

537
01:32:08,768 --> 01:32:10,901
She said it makes time last longer.

538
01:33:08,995 --> 01:33:10,185
Your eyes.

539
01:34:01,756 --> 01:34:03,264
You have to drink.

540
01:35:17,777 --> 01:35:19,361
This time, I like it.

541
01:35:21,785 --> 01:35:24,178
Perhaps because I know you better.

542
01:35:25,250 --> 01:35:26,913
Perhaps I've changed.

543
01:35:27,056 --> 01:35:28,338
Perhaps.

544
01:35:36,573 --> 01:35:39,115
You didn't destroy the last one for me.

545
01:35:41,468 --> 01:35:42,900
You did it for you.

546
01:35:46,235 --> 01:35:48,503
I'd like to destroy this one too.

547
01:35:50,249 --> 01:35:50,995
Why?

548
01:36:01,259 --> 01:36:03,243
Through it, I give you to another.

549
01:36:19,023 --> 01:36:20,460
It's terrible.

550
01:36:22,468 --> 01:36:24,856
Now you possess me a little,
you bear me a grudge.

551
01:36:26,182 --> 01:36:27,757
- I don't.
- You do.

552
01:36:29,117 --> 01:36:30,708
You know you do.

553
01:36:34,951 --> 01:36:36,618
You're not on my side now.

554
01:36:36,887 --> 01:36:39,852
You blame me for what comes next.
My marriage.

555
01:36:40,388 --> 01:36:41,788
You don't support me.

556
01:36:43,360 --> 01:36:44,729
You're right.

557
01:36:50,904 --> 01:36:52,304
Go on.

558
01:36:53,562 --> 01:36:55,405
Say what burdens your heart.

559
01:37:03,158 --> 01:37:05,238
I believed you braver.

560
01:37:05,294 --> 01:37:07,388
I believed you braver too.

561
01:37:10,139 --> 01:37:11,544
That's it then.

562
01:37:12,735 --> 01:37:14,135
You find me docile.

563
01:37:15,354 --> 01:37:16,522
Worse...

564
01:37:17,916 --> 01:37:19,749
You imagine I'm collusive.

565
01:37:21,924 --> 01:37:23,348
You imagine my pleasure.

566
01:37:24,032 --> 01:37:25,964
It's a way of avoiding hope.

567
01:37:28,115 --> 01:37:32,274
Imagine me happy or unhappy
if that reassures you.

568
01:37:33,488 --> 01:37:35,639
But do not imagine me guilty.

569
01:37:38,702 --> 01:37:40,484
You'd prefer me to resist.

570
01:37:45,111 --> 01:37:46,119
Yes.

571
01:37:46,814 --> 01:37:48,644
Are you asking me to?

572
01:37:52,600 --> 01:37:53,794
Answer me.

573
01:37:55,529 --> 01:37:56,521
No.

574
01:38:30,714 --> 01:38:32,158
Have you seen Héloïse?

575
01:38:32,642 --> 01:38:35,239
No. She isn't in her room.

576
01:38:38,697 --> 01:38:40,081
We've had news.

577
01:38:42,481 --> 01:38:44,026
Madam returns tomorrow.

578
01:38:44,664 --> 01:38:45,965
Very well.

579
01:38:46,408 --> 01:38:47,848
Will you be ready?

580
01:38:50,244 --> 01:38:51,443
Yes.

581
01:39:20,115 --> 01:39:21,515
Forgive me.

582
01:39:27,479 --> 01:39:28,884
Forgive me.

583
01:39:41,159 --> 01:39:43,079
Your mother returns tomorrow.

584
01:40:47,178 --> 01:40:48,606
Come here.

585
01:40:48,980 --> 01:40:50,385
With me.

586
01:41:15,818 --> 01:41:17,833
When do we know it's finished?

587
01:41:21,027 --> 01:41:22,599
At one point, we stop.

588
01:42:13,291 --> 01:42:14,669
Finished.

589
01:42:25,744 --> 01:42:27,044
Who is that for?

590
01:42:29,273 --> 01:42:30,577
For me.

591
01:42:37,207 --> 01:42:39,729
You can reproduce that image
to infinity.

592
01:42:41,191 --> 01:42:42,390
Yes.

593
01:42:48,054 --> 01:42:49,511
After a while,

594
01:42:50,856 --> 01:42:52,256
you'll see her

595
01:42:53,062 --> 01:42:54,415
when you think of me.

596
01:43:00,140 --> 01:43:01,553
I'll have no image of you.

597
01:43:06,032 --> 01:43:07,945
Do you want an image of me?

598
01:43:09,722 --> 01:43:10,803
Yes.

599
01:43:13,712 --> 01:43:14,807
Which one?

600
01:43:16,204 --> 01:43:17,410
That one.

601
01:43:24,106 --> 01:43:25,503
Give me your book.

602
01:43:28,932 --> 01:43:30,337
Give me a figure.

603
01:43:31,139 --> 01:43:32,345
28.

604
01:44:25,140 --> 01:44:26,587
Your eyes are closing.

605
01:44:32,646 --> 01:44:34,042
Don't go to sleep.

606
01:44:50,046 --> 01:44:51,577
I feel something new.

607
01:44:54,417 --> 01:44:55,655
What?

608
01:44:57,923 --> 01:44:59,323
Regret.

609
01:45:03,836 --> 01:45:05,259
Don't regret.

610
01:45:08,621 --> 01:45:09,875
Remember.

611
01:45:18,873 --> 01:45:22,314
I'll remember when you fell asleep
in the kitchen.

612
01:45:26,978 --> 01:45:28,694
I'll remember...

613
01:45:30,488 --> 01:45:32,297
your dark look

614
01:45:32,741 --> 01:45:34,845
when I beat you at cards.

615
01:45:41,975 --> 01:45:44,483
I'll remember
the first time you laughed.

616
01:45:46,102 --> 01:45:48,205
You took your time being funny.

617
01:45:48,914 --> 01:45:50,245
That's true.

618
01:45:50,789 --> 01:45:52,280
I wasted time.

619
01:45:54,067 --> 01:45:55,581
I wasted time too.

620
01:46:01,627 --> 01:46:05,152
I'll remember
the first time I wanted to kiss you.

621
01:46:08,932 --> 01:46:10,337
When was that?

622
01:46:11,889 --> 01:46:13,289
You didn't notice?

623
01:46:17,829 --> 01:46:19,728
At the feast around the bonfire.

624
01:46:22,150 --> 01:46:23,550
I wanted to, yes.

625
01:46:24,385 --> 01:46:26,400
But that wasn't the first time.

626
01:46:29,534 --> 01:46:30,902
Tell me.

627
01:46:32,115 --> 01:46:33,761
No, you tell me.

628
01:46:43,229 --> 01:46:45,562
When you asked if I had known love.

629
01:46:49,738 --> 01:46:51,928
I could tell the answer was yes.

630
01:46:52,912 --> 01:46:54,584
And that it was now.

631
01:47:00,456 --> 01:47:01,944
I remember.

632
01:47:39,890 --> 01:47:41,082
Good morning.

633
01:47:41,439 --> 01:47:42,456
Good morning.

634
01:47:57,928 --> 01:47:58,928
They're here.

635
01:48:42,329 --> 01:48:43,536
Very good.

636
01:48:51,057 --> 01:48:52,295
For you.

637
01:48:53,620 --> 01:48:54,874
Thank you.

638
01:49:03,078 --> 01:49:04,387
Héloïse...

639
01:49:04,880 --> 01:49:06,280
Come with me.

640
01:49:07,973 --> 01:49:09,362
In a minute.

641
01:49:09,520 --> 01:49:11,008
No, now.

642
01:49:11,643 --> 01:49:13,254
I have a gift for you.

643
01:50:02,570 --> 01:50:04,089
I'll say goodbye here.

644
01:50:13,623 --> 01:50:14,925
Goodbye.

645
01:50:50,133 --> 01:50:51,633
Have a safe journey.

646
01:51:17,437 --> 01:51:18,761
Turn around.

647
01:51:50,190 --> 01:51:52,083
You've made me look so sad.

648
01:51:57,027 --> 01:51:58,352
You were.

649
01:51:59,599 --> 01:52:00,923
I'm not anymore.

650
01:52:10,661 --> 01:52:12,567
<i>I saw her again a first time.</i>

651
01:52:36,585 --> 01:52:38,044
Are you standing guard?

652
01:52:38,894 --> 01:52:40,696
I'm observing reactions.

653
01:52:41,149 --> 01:52:42,549
Do you want mine?

654
01:52:42,890 --> 01:52:44,573
This Orpheus is excellent.

655
01:52:45,251 --> 01:52:46,877
Your father is in shape.

656
01:52:47,082 --> 01:52:49,990
It's my painting.
I submitted it in his name.

657
01:52:53,111 --> 01:52:55,824
Usually, he's portrayed before he turns

658
01:52:56,134 --> 01:52:58,456
or after, as Eurydice dies.

659
01:52:59,115 --> 01:53:01,794
Here, they seem to be saying goodbye.

660
01:54:10,734 --> 01:54:12,267
<i>I saw her one last time.</i>

661
01:55:35,295 --> 01:55:36,792
<i>She didn't see me.</i>
