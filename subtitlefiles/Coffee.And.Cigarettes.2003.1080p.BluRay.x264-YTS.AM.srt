1
00:02:17,290 --> 00:02:19,656
Yeah, hello. You're Steve?

2
00:02:19,892 --> 00:02:21,723
Steven. Hi.

3
00:02:21,894 --> 00:02:23,953
- Sit down.
- Roberto?

4
00:02:28,801 --> 00:02:30,769
- I'm all wound up.
- Yeah.

5
00:02:30,970 --> 00:02:33,996
You're wound up? I'm wound up, too.

6
00:02:34,907 --> 00:02:36,602
- Yes.
- All wound up.

7
00:02:38,477 --> 00:02:40,502
- What are you drinking? Coffee?
- Coffee, yes.

8
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:42,841
- Very good for me. For you?
- I love coffee.

9
00:02:43,015 --> 00:02:44,312
- You love it, too?
- I love it.

10
00:02:44,517 --> 00:02:45,950
- Steve.
- Steven.

11
00:02:48,287 --> 00:02:49,754
I love coffee.

12
00:02:50,690 --> 00:02:52,180
What do you do?

13
00:02:52,858 --> 00:02:56,487
You know, I just relax, sit around,
maybe have a cigarette.

14
00:02:57,096 --> 00:02:59,690
Cigarettes and coffee
I think go together good.

15
00:02:59,865 --> 00:03:02,197
You think you drink too much of it?

16
00:03:02,368 --> 00:03:04,928
No. Coffee is good for health.

17
00:03:05,671 --> 00:03:07,639
I like to drink before I go to sleep.

18
00:03:07,807 --> 00:03:10,867
I drink a lot of coffee before I go to sleep
so I can dream faster.

19
00:03:11,043 --> 00:03:13,637
I can dream like when they put a camera
on the Indy 500...

20
00:03:13,813 --> 00:03:17,112
when they put a camera in the car,
and it's just whipping by like that.

21
00:03:17,283 --> 00:03:19,274
Dream after dream after dream after dream.

22
00:03:19,452 --> 00:03:21,818
People ask me the next day,
what did you dream about?

23
00:03:22,021 --> 00:03:25,650
I say, I don't have time.
I don't have time to tell you this.

24
00:03:32,398 --> 00:03:35,629
- Do you smoke?
- Only when I drink coffee.

25
00:03:36,869 --> 00:03:38,666
Do you know my mother?

26
00:03:40,573 --> 00:03:42,507
- Do I know your mother?
- Yeah.

27
00:03:42,708 --> 00:03:44,903
I don't know. I don't think so.

28
00:03:46,178 --> 00:03:49,011
- Coffee. They should freeze it, you know?
- Yes.

29
00:03:49,181 --> 00:03:52,708
Fill an ice-cube tray with coffee
and put sticks in it, for kids.

30
00:03:52,885 --> 00:03:56,082
So they can start when they're kids,
when they're playing and stuff.

31
00:03:56,255 --> 00:03:58,849
Like a Popsicle. A caffeine Popsicle.

32
00:03:59,058 --> 00:04:01,856
Very good. I don't understand nothing. Yes.

33
00:04:18,244 --> 00:04:20,075
- Can you hear me?
- What?

34
00:04:20,246 --> 00:04:22,043
Can you hear me? It's very loud over here.

35
00:04:22,248 --> 00:04:25,581
You having trouble hearing me?
Maybe we should switch.

36
00:04:26,419 --> 00:04:30,014
Yes, thank you very much. I'd like to switch.

37
00:04:33,426 --> 00:04:34,723
Good here.

38
00:04:40,866 --> 00:04:44,063
- Good?
- I kind of liked it better over there.

39
00:04:45,805 --> 00:04:47,204
- You go...
- Do you mind?

40
00:04:47,373 --> 00:04:49,398
Yes, me, too. I prefer, yes.

41
00:04:55,214 --> 00:04:56,545
Steve, yes.

42
00:05:08,794 --> 00:05:11,388
- When do you leave?
- The United States?

43
00:05:11,564 --> 00:05:12,758
No, here.

44
00:05:12,932 --> 00:05:16,925
I have to leave soon, actually.
I have a dentist appointment.

45
00:05:19,238 --> 00:05:22,332
But I don't want to go.
I don't like the dentist.

46
00:05:25,277 --> 00:05:26,972
I gotta go, I guess.

47
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:29,978
- Yes.
- I haven't gone in a while.

48
00:05:31,116 --> 00:05:33,607
Good. You don't go?

49
00:05:35,087 --> 00:05:38,648
- I should go, but I don't feel like going.
- No?

50
00:05:43,195 --> 00:05:45,993
I am free, very free.

51
00:05:47,466 --> 00:05:49,161
You wanna go for me?

52
00:05:49,802 --> 00:05:50,928
Thank you very much.

53
00:05:51,103 --> 00:05:53,367
- You wanna go to the dentist?
- Yes, I can go for you.

54
00:05:53,539 --> 00:05:54,631
Great.

55
00:05:55,641 --> 00:05:57,632
- Here's the address.
- Good.

56
00:05:58,878 --> 00:05:59,970
Good. Very good.

57
00:06:00,145 --> 00:06:02,272
- The name of the guy.
- Yeah, 4:30.

58
00:06:03,449 --> 00:06:06,816
- Steven, thank you very much.
- No problem.

59
00:06:07,119 --> 00:06:09,144
- You don't mind?
- No, thank you.

60
00:06:09,355 --> 00:06:11,550
Dentist appointment, very good.

61
00:06:13,692 --> 00:06:15,887
I have to go. I am sorry, Steve.

62
00:06:16,695 --> 00:06:19,858
Steve, I have to go to the dentist. I am late.

63
00:06:20,199 --> 00:06:23,828
- Thank you, excuse me. Sorry.
- Take it easy, don't be late.

64
00:06:25,304 --> 00:06:28,501
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you too, in a way.

65
00:07:13,686 --> 00:07:16,177
What are we doing in Memphis, anyway?

66
00:07:16,755 --> 00:07:18,586
- It was your idea to come here.
- Your idea.

67
00:07:18,757 --> 00:07:21,123
It was my idea? It was your idea.

68
00:07:29,101 --> 00:07:30,432
Very funny.

69
00:07:37,443 --> 00:07:40,241
Don't smoke those sawdust cigarettes
in here.

70
00:07:40,446 --> 00:07:41,913
I hate those things.

71
00:07:42,114 --> 00:07:43,979
- So what?
- What are you, a cowboy?

72
00:07:44,149 --> 00:07:47,641
- These are fresh. This is fresh tobacco.
- No, this is fresh.

73
00:07:47,820 --> 00:07:52,416
- This is the stupid dope fresh cigarettes.
- That stuff is stale. What are you, crazy?

74
00:07:53,459 --> 00:07:55,893
- I'm not crazy.
- Shut up.

75
00:08:00,399 --> 00:08:02,424
How we doing here? Need a refill?

76
00:08:02,601 --> 00:08:03,829
- Yeah.
- No.

77
00:08:04,470 --> 00:08:06,633
- Sir?
- Yes.

78
00:08:14,780 --> 00:08:16,338
Shit. I'm sorry.

79
00:08:17,082 --> 00:08:20,950
- Come on, what are you doing, man?
- Damn, I'm sorry about that.

80
00:08:21,587 --> 00:08:24,920
Let's not even pay the check.
This place is terrible.

81
00:08:25,824 --> 00:08:27,951
This all you're gonna have?

82
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:30,424
- Give me a light.
- Just coffee and cigarettes?

83
00:08:30,596 --> 00:08:32,461
That's not too healthy, is it now?

84
00:08:32,631 --> 00:08:35,464
- Can I get you a sandwich or something?
- No.

85
00:08:35,968 --> 00:08:38,129
- Y'all from around here?
- No.

86
00:08:39,471 --> 00:08:40,870
Are you brother and sister?

87
00:08:41,040 --> 00:08:42,268
- Yes.
- No.

88
00:08:44,710 --> 00:08:46,041
Are you two twins?

89
00:08:46,211 --> 00:08:47,439
- Yes.
- No.

90
00:08:47,713 --> 00:08:49,044
Yes, we are.

91
00:08:49,515 --> 00:08:52,541
I thought so.
You know who y'all remind me of?

92
00:08:52,785 --> 00:08:54,685
- Who?
- Heckle and Jeckle.

93
00:08:56,188 --> 00:08:57,280
Shit.

94
00:08:57,856 --> 00:09:00,552
You know, the talking magpies?

95
00:09:02,895 --> 00:09:06,626
Anyway, who's the evil twin?
That's the way it works, right?

96
00:09:08,300 --> 00:09:10,825
- This coffee tastes like mud.
- Really.

97
00:09:13,038 --> 00:09:16,337
Which one of us do you think
looks like the evil one?

98
00:09:16,575 --> 00:09:20,067
I'd say he's the evil one, right?
He's got the evil eye.

99
00:09:22,147 --> 00:09:24,513
- I'm only kidding.
- You better be.

100
00:09:24,717 --> 00:09:28,676
You know, I just thought of something,
with you two being twins and all.

101
00:09:28,854 --> 00:09:31,254
- Did y'all go to Graceland yet?
- No.

102
00:09:31,423 --> 00:09:33,084
You should. It's real cool.

103
00:09:33,258 --> 00:09:35,556
- Mind if I sit down?
- Yes, I do.

104
00:09:35,728 --> 00:09:38,822
Yes, you can sit down.
What are you, on a break?

105
00:09:39,364 --> 00:09:42,822
Not really, but it's kind of slow.
Tell you what, you can help me out.

106
00:09:43,001 --> 00:09:47,028
Just stay right there. You got me covered
and my boss can't see me.

107
00:09:48,674 --> 00:09:50,733
It's his evil nature, right?

108
00:09:51,910 --> 00:09:53,605
Anyway, what I just thought of,

109
00:09:53,779 --> 00:09:56,748
do you know that
Elvis Presley's got a twin brother?

110
00:09:56,915 --> 00:10:00,715
Yeah, his name is Jesse Garon.
You know, Elvis' middle name is Aaron.

111
00:10:00,919 --> 00:10:04,855
Aaron, Garon. Anyway,
everybody thinks that he died at birth.

112
00:10:05,023 --> 00:10:06,615
But my theory is...

113
00:10:06,792 --> 00:10:10,228
that his mother didn't wanna raise two kids.
She wasn't expecting twins.

114
00:10:10,395 --> 00:10:12,727
She couldn't afford to raise both.
She gave one away.

115
00:10:12,898 --> 00:10:17,358
She just sent one off. So Jesse grew up
in Arkansas, or Mississippi, or something.

116
00:10:17,536 --> 00:10:21,233
So he didn't know he had a brother, Elvis.
But one day, like, 1968 or '69...

117
00:10:21,406 --> 00:10:24,898
he's looking at himself in the mirror
and says, "Damn, I look like Elvis".

118
00:10:25,077 --> 00:10:27,637
So he comes to Memphis, looks up Elvis.

119
00:10:27,813 --> 00:10:31,249
Elvis sees him, he says,
"Yeah, you're my brother. I can't believe it!"

120
00:10:31,416 --> 00:10:33,941
"How you doing? What can I do for you?"

121
00:10:34,119 --> 00:10:36,781
And his brother says, "Well, I don't know".

122
00:10:36,955 --> 00:10:39,822
"Sure would be nice
to be you for one night."

123
00:10:40,325 --> 00:10:43,624
So Elvis had this concert
where his brother sang.

124
00:10:43,796 --> 00:10:48,597
They tried to see if they could trick people.
Damn if he didn't sound like his brother!

125
00:10:48,834 --> 00:10:50,597
Then Elvis had an idea.

126
00:10:50,803 --> 00:10:53,670
I'm tired of the music scene.
I'll send him out on tour.

127
00:10:53,839 --> 00:10:57,468
Big mistake, because it was his brother
who started to go to Vegas...

128
00:10:57,643 --> 00:11:01,272
and wear them big collars,
the white jumpsuits, and the capes.

129
00:11:01,446 --> 00:11:04,938
Elvis wouldn't do that.
And it was his brother who got really fat.

130
00:11:05,150 --> 00:11:08,950
You know, eating those
banana-fried butter sandwiches and all.

131
00:11:09,121 --> 00:11:12,750
The Colonel said, "We gotta get rid
of this guy. He can't be Elvis anymore."

132
00:11:12,925 --> 00:11:16,452
So they started feeding him pills.
I think they killed him.

133
00:11:18,363 --> 00:11:21,628
So what? What are you saying?
What's the punch line?

134
00:11:24,703 --> 00:11:26,796
- Y'all are Elvis fans?
- No.

135
00:11:29,842 --> 00:11:33,278
You wanna hear something about Elvis?
I'll tell you something about him.

136
00:11:33,445 --> 00:11:36,312
- You ever heard of Otis Blackwell?
- No, ma'am.

137
00:11:36,515 --> 00:11:39,382
- You ever heard of Junior Parker?
- No, ma'am.

138
00:11:39,685 --> 00:11:43,280
Yeah, I didn't think so.
You know, Elvis robbed their music, man.

139
00:11:43,455 --> 00:11:47,789
He paid them $10 for their music,
and all these other black musicians, too.

140
00:11:47,960 --> 00:11:50,793
- That's what I think of Elvis.
- Here's where my theory fits.

141
00:11:50,963 --> 00:11:53,864
I don't think it was Elvis.
I think it was his brother.

142
00:11:54,032 --> 00:11:56,193
So in that case, it's all right?

143
00:11:57,703 --> 00:12:02,538
My favorite Elvis quote is, "The only thing
colors can do for me is shine my shoes".

144
00:12:04,042 --> 00:12:08,206
I don't think the King said that.
See, I think it was his evil twin.

145
00:12:09,815 --> 00:12:13,410
Danny, what you doing over there?
You got tables to wait on. Come on.

146
00:12:13,585 --> 00:12:16,383
- I'll be right back.
- Yeah, don't get fired, man.

147
00:12:17,756 --> 00:12:19,519
Slaphappy hillbilly.

148
00:12:20,425 --> 00:12:21,585
Cheers.

149
00:12:25,063 --> 00:12:27,327
Something smells funny in here.

150
00:12:32,838 --> 00:12:34,897
Is that my shirt you got on?

151
00:12:37,676 --> 00:12:38,870
No, I don't think so.

152
00:12:39,044 --> 00:12:41,444
Yeah, I think it is.
This doesn't smell like me.

153
00:12:41,613 --> 00:12:42,841
Yeah? What do you smell like?

154
00:12:43,015 --> 00:12:45,074
I smell like me,
and this doesn't smell like me.

155
00:12:45,250 --> 00:12:48,048
- I smell like me, too.
- But this smells like you.

156
00:12:48,253 --> 00:12:50,050
That's because I am me.

157
00:12:51,023 --> 00:12:52,456
Is that my shirt?

158
00:12:52,624 --> 00:12:55,184
- Why you always copying me, anyway?
- I'm not copying you.

159
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:57,794
- Why don't you get your own style?
- I have my own style.

160
00:12:57,963 --> 00:13:01,558
No, you're always copying me.
Your style is my style because you copy it.

161
00:13:01,733 --> 00:13:03,792
- It's my style.
- No, it's not your style.

162
00:13:03,969 --> 00:13:06,699
Service is bad, the coffee is bad,
the music sucks.

163
00:13:06,872 --> 00:13:07,964
Those are my shoes.

164
00:13:08,140 --> 00:13:09,869
- These are my shoes.
- Those are my shoes.

165
00:13:10,042 --> 00:13:12,033
- These are my shoes.
- Those are my other shoes.

166
00:13:12,210 --> 00:13:13,108
Bullshit.

167
00:14:02,995 --> 00:14:04,690
- Hey.
- Hey, Tom.

168
00:14:04,997 --> 00:14:07,625
- All right.
- I'm glad you could make it.

169
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:10,090
You are here.

170
00:14:11,336 --> 00:14:13,270
You know, you can call me Jim.

171
00:14:13,438 --> 00:14:17,465
I mean, you know, my friends call me Jim,
or Jimmy, or Iggy, or Jiggy.

172
00:14:17,876 --> 00:14:19,366
Call me Iggy.

173
00:14:21,013 --> 00:14:25,109
Okay, all right, whichever way you go.
I'll go either way, Jim or Iggy...

174
00:14:25,283 --> 00:14:27,308
You call me Iggy.

175
00:14:27,819 --> 00:14:32,188
Look, I'm sorry I'm late, Jim.
Boy, four-car pileup.

176
00:14:34,292 --> 00:14:36,453
I delivered a baby this morning
at about 9:00.

177
00:14:36,628 --> 00:14:40,359
I was saving lives,
I was out there on the highway, it was...

178
00:14:40,832 --> 00:14:43,528
You know, there's nothing worse
than roadside surgery.

179
00:14:43,702 --> 00:14:47,365
You don't have your own tools,
and it's just... It's murder.

180
00:14:48,073 --> 00:14:51,509
I performed a tracheotomy
with a ballpoint pen and...

181
00:14:53,645 --> 00:14:55,135
I've been busy.

182
00:14:56,882 --> 00:14:59,510
Wait a minute. You're a doctor?

183
00:15:01,186 --> 00:15:03,381
Yeah, I'm a doctor.

184
00:15:05,590 --> 00:15:08,582
Music and medicine, really.
It's really been my thing.

185
00:15:08,760 --> 00:15:13,220
It's combining the two
and living in that place where they overlap.

186
00:15:14,733 --> 00:15:18,499
A lot of people say it shows up in the music.
I don't know. I mean, it's...

187
00:15:18,670 --> 00:15:21,764
Well, okay. Yeah, I can see that.

188
00:15:23,708 --> 00:15:27,371
Yeah, okay. I think the organization
and the whole thing...

189
00:15:27,546 --> 00:15:28,774
- The humanity, I guess.
- Yeah.

190
00:15:28,947 --> 00:15:33,611
- The humanity of the thing. The regard.
- Yeah, the regard.

191
00:15:34,352 --> 00:15:38,584
- I guess it's a big day for you, then.
- It is. It was a medical morning.

192
00:15:38,757 --> 00:15:41,385
- Everybody's all right?
- Everybody's fine.

193
00:15:43,762 --> 00:15:45,627
You've been here a while, I see.

194
00:15:45,797 --> 00:15:48,561
I've been here. Drinking a little coffee.

195
00:15:48,733 --> 00:15:51,065
- Yeah, I see.
- I ordered you some.

196
00:15:53,605 --> 00:15:55,266
You ordered for me?

197
00:15:56,441 --> 00:15:58,773
I mean, is it cool? Is that cool?

198
00:15:59,411 --> 00:16:01,971
Yeah, okay. Coffee, yeah.

199
00:16:03,615 --> 00:16:05,913
- I could go for a coffee.
- Okay, man.

200
00:16:06,284 --> 00:16:08,309
Come on, have some coffee.

201
00:16:10,789 --> 00:16:12,484
Okay, coffee it is.

202
00:16:33,578 --> 00:16:35,011
Are those your cigarettes?

203
00:16:35,180 --> 00:16:38,240
No, they were just sitting here
when I got here.

204
00:16:39,017 --> 00:16:41,645
- You don't smoke, do you?
- No. I gave it up.

205
00:16:41,820 --> 00:16:43,617
- Not for me, either.
- Boy, enough of that.

206
00:16:43,788 --> 00:16:45,915
That was enough, 25 big ones.

207
00:16:47,492 --> 00:16:49,790
- Finished.
- Got the energy now.

208
00:16:51,863 --> 00:16:55,196
Since I quit, I mean, just everything...

209
00:16:56,301 --> 00:16:57,461
Yeah, you're focused.

210
00:16:57,636 --> 00:17:00,366
- Zeroed in. Bang, you know?
- Me, too.

211
00:17:01,006 --> 00:17:05,443
I feel sorry for suckers still puffing away,
you know?

212
00:17:05,844 --> 00:17:08,506
- No willpower.
- No willpower. Pacifier.

213
00:17:09,447 --> 00:17:10,539
Silly.

214
00:17:12,350 --> 00:17:16,980
You know, the beauty of quitting is,
now that I've quit...

215
00:17:18,790 --> 00:17:21,520
I can have one. Because I've quit.

216
00:17:24,529 --> 00:17:26,656
I mean, it's just like jewelry.

217
00:17:26,831 --> 00:17:30,358
You know, it's not really...
I don't even inhale.

218
00:17:32,971 --> 00:17:34,905
You want to join me in one?

219
00:17:36,007 --> 00:17:38,066
Yeah, since I quit. Okay.

220
00:17:38,243 --> 00:17:40,905
- Now that you've quit, you can have one.
- Sure, yeah.

221
00:17:41,079 --> 00:17:43,047
I can do that. All right.

222
00:17:51,723 --> 00:17:53,384
Boy, thank you.

223
00:17:53,558 --> 00:17:57,426
Yeah, you know what I mean?
Now that we've quit...

224
00:18:03,068 --> 00:18:06,697
Cigarettes and coffee, man.
That's a combination.

225
00:18:07,906 --> 00:18:09,373
Can't beat it.

226
00:18:12,177 --> 00:18:16,614
We're really the coffee-and-cigarettes
generation, when you think about it.

227
00:18:18,049 --> 00:18:22,179
You know what I mean? In the '40s,
it was the pie-and-coffee generation.

228
00:18:22,854 --> 00:18:27,052
Like Abbott and Costello on TV, man.
They always wanted pie and coffee.

229
00:18:27,892 --> 00:18:31,794
Yeah, like Abbott and Costello.
They were always ordering pie and coffee.

230
00:18:31,963 --> 00:18:34,056
Have some coffee.
Have some pie and coffee.

231
00:18:34,232 --> 00:18:36,359
What are you waiting for?

232
00:18:42,540 --> 00:18:44,440
You hang out here a lot?

233
00:18:48,246 --> 00:18:49,941
This is my hangout.

234
00:18:50,949 --> 00:18:55,147
I just wondered, 'cause I didn't see
anything of yours on the jukebox.

235
00:19:01,293 --> 00:19:05,252
If you don't like it here, we could
go down to Taco Bell or something.

236
00:19:05,463 --> 00:19:07,624
Maybe that's more your style.

237
00:19:09,634 --> 00:19:13,764
What are you saying, man?
You're saying I'm a Taco Bell kind of guy?

238
00:19:14,306 --> 00:19:17,275
No. I mean, if you don't like it here.

239
00:19:17,642 --> 00:19:20,805
- You said you don't like it here.
- No, I didn't say that.

240
00:19:20,979 --> 00:19:23,174
We could go to
the International House of Pancakes.

241
00:19:23,348 --> 00:19:25,316
Maybe that's more up your alley.
I don't know.

242
00:19:25,483 --> 00:19:29,419
I didn't say that. I don't wanna go
to the International House of Pancakes.

243
00:19:29,587 --> 00:19:31,111
I'm comfortable.

244
00:19:40,532 --> 00:19:42,523
Coffee is good, though, at IHOP.

245
00:19:42,701 --> 00:19:45,329
You like the coffee down there at IHOP?

246
00:19:49,808 --> 00:19:53,642
I drink the coffee at IHOP.
I like the coffee. You don't like it?

247
00:19:53,812 --> 00:19:57,270
Yeah, man. I like the IHOP coffee.

248
00:19:57,682 --> 00:20:00,708
- Classy brew.
- Yeah, that's good coffee.

249
00:20:03,555 --> 00:20:06,149
Yeah, that's good coffee at the IHOP.

250
00:20:14,299 --> 00:20:16,199
I almost forgot. Listen.

251
00:20:17,068 --> 00:20:19,662
I worked with this drummer
the other day in LA.

252
00:20:19,871 --> 00:20:23,034
And this guy, man, his name is Giant Robo.

253
00:20:23,708 --> 00:20:28,008
He was clanging and banging really hard.
Man, I thought of you.

254
00:20:28,213 --> 00:20:29,237
Maybe you want to...

255
00:20:29,414 --> 00:20:32,713
This is somebody,
I think you ought to check him out.

256
00:20:34,319 --> 00:20:37,482
You mean,
you think I need a professional drummer?

257
00:20:37,822 --> 00:20:39,517
I'm not good enough?

258
00:20:40,925 --> 00:20:42,358
What are you talking about?

259
00:20:42,527 --> 00:20:45,894
No, but I'm just...
You know, it's a musician.

260
00:20:46,064 --> 00:20:50,091
I thought... I just wanted to tell you
about this guy. It'd be great, man.

261
00:20:50,268 --> 00:20:54,932
It's hard and industrial, and he's beating,
and I just thought, "wow".

262
00:20:59,411 --> 00:21:02,539
What are you trying to tell me?
I need a drummer?

263
00:21:03,415 --> 00:21:05,212
I could use a drummer?

264
00:21:06,284 --> 00:21:09,742
The drumming on my records sucks?
What are you saying?

265
00:21:16,127 --> 00:21:17,685
Forget it, man.

266
00:21:49,494 --> 00:21:50,961
You know what?

267
00:21:51,429 --> 00:21:54,489
- I think I really got to get going.
- You got to go?

268
00:21:54,666 --> 00:21:56,793
Maybe another cup?
Maybe another cigarette?

269
00:21:56,968 --> 00:21:58,560
Boy, I'd like to.

270
00:21:59,137 --> 00:22:02,971
No. I really gotta go. I mean...

271
00:22:05,810 --> 00:22:09,143
My wife, she's alone in a motel.

272
00:22:10,815 --> 00:22:12,806
Maybe we could call her up,
come on down here.

273
00:22:12,984 --> 00:22:16,010
Have a cup of coffee
and a couple of cigarettes.

274
00:22:17,088 --> 00:22:20,524
She doesn't smoke.
You know, it's the willpower.

275
00:22:20,692 --> 00:22:22,489
- I see.
- I don't want to start her.

276
00:22:22,660 --> 00:22:24,958
No, you don't want to get her started.

277
00:22:25,330 --> 00:22:28,197
- This is our little thing here.
- Yeah, right.

278
00:22:28,500 --> 00:22:31,298
But we can just sort of...

279
00:22:32,203 --> 00:22:34,637
We can just keep zipping along, you know.

280
00:22:34,806 --> 00:22:36,671
I'll be thinking of you.

281
00:22:38,443 --> 00:22:40,308
- Gotta go.
- I guess so.

282
00:22:42,146 --> 00:22:44,478
- See you soon.
- Yeah, okay.

283
00:22:45,884 --> 00:22:48,478
I wish you could stay a little longer.

284
00:22:50,388 --> 00:22:53,880
- We were just starting to get going here.
- Gotta go.

285
00:22:58,296 --> 00:22:59,558
Okay, Jim.

286
00:22:59,898 --> 00:23:01,991
- Next time.
- Okay, next time.

287
00:23:02,333 --> 00:23:04,801
- You take care.
- You take care, too.

288
00:23:29,661 --> 00:23:31,595
He's not on here, either.

289
00:24:31,956 --> 00:24:35,050
- You're a fucking moron, you know that?
- Now what?

290
00:24:35,793 --> 00:24:38,990
I can't believe that
you're still smoking those fucking things.

291
00:24:39,163 --> 00:24:41,222
Vinny, they'll fuck you up.

292
00:24:41,466 --> 00:24:43,627
They'll kill you. Believe me.

293
00:24:44,736 --> 00:24:47,000
Were you put on this fucking earth
to annoy me?

294
00:24:47,171 --> 00:24:48,968
You said you were gonna quit.

295
00:24:49,140 --> 00:24:51,574
Instead, you spend a fortune...

296
00:24:51,743 --> 00:24:54,906
so those big tobacco companies
can get fucking rich.

297
00:24:55,079 --> 00:24:56,603
And then you get cancer.

298
00:24:56,781 --> 00:25:00,740
And then the fucking doctors
and the hospitals, they can get rich.

299
00:25:00,918 --> 00:25:02,749
And the undertakers, too.

300
00:25:02,920 --> 00:25:05,115
All because you want to smoke
like a fucking moron.

301
00:25:05,289 --> 00:25:08,190
I can't help it. I'm fucking addicted, okay?

302
00:25:08,593 --> 00:25:10,493
So, coffee and cigarettes?

303
00:25:11,029 --> 00:25:14,260
That's your lunch? That ain't healthy, is it?

304
00:25:14,269 --> 00:25:17,068
You're drinking coffee
so don't break my fuckin' balls.

305
00:25:17,168 --> 00:25:19,659
Vinny, I had lunch already.

306
00:25:20,672 --> 00:25:23,038
So I'm on a diet, okay? Jesus!

307
00:25:27,879 --> 00:25:29,938
Here comes my freaking kid.

308
00:25:38,523 --> 00:25:41,390
Do me a favor.
Don't tell your mother, please.

309
00:25:41,559 --> 00:25:45,552
What the fuck am I talking about?
She smokes like a locomotive, anyway.

310
00:25:46,230 --> 00:25:48,061
How you doing, Junior?

311
00:25:49,701 --> 00:25:52,465
- He don't talk much, does he?
- Not lately.

312
00:25:52,870 --> 00:25:55,236
Lately he's been the silent type.

313
00:25:56,574 --> 00:26:00,010
I gave you $10 last night.
So what did you do with it?

314
00:26:08,753 --> 00:26:10,482
I just gave you $5.

315
00:26:14,559 --> 00:26:17,255
Listen, I'll give you $1 more. That's it.

316
00:26:18,563 --> 00:26:22,055
Can I at least get a hug?
For $6, can I get a freaking hug?

317
00:26:22,734 --> 00:26:24,201
$10 for a hug?

318
00:26:24,402 --> 00:26:28,532
You gotta be out of your freaking mind.
All right, come here. I'll give you.

319
00:26:30,608 --> 00:26:33,702
You better go get yourself something to eat,
and something good.

320
00:26:33,878 --> 00:26:37,439
Yeah, just like him.
Get some coffee and cigarettes.

321
00:26:38,049 --> 00:26:40,210
Oh, brother!
What the fuck are you talking about?

322
00:26:40,384 --> 00:26:42,045
Look how much coffee you're drinking.

323
00:26:42,220 --> 00:26:44,347
You got the whole fucking pot
over there with you.

324
00:26:44,522 --> 00:26:47,218
So what? They always bring me a whole pot.

325
00:26:47,458 --> 00:26:49,790
I like coffee. Keeps me going.

326
00:26:50,094 --> 00:26:54,190
It keeps you going, all right.
You're a fucking maniac. A caffeine maniac.

327
00:26:54,365 --> 00:26:56,230
- You're drinking coffee, ain't you?
- Yeah.

328
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:58,891
- So?
- So maybe you should try to quit.

329
00:27:01,606 --> 00:27:04,404
- I ain't no fucking quitter.
- I'll drink to that.

330
00:27:13,384 --> 00:27:14,817
Fucking moron.

331
00:27:15,453 --> 00:27:17,614
Shit, here comes my kid again.

332
00:27:21,726 --> 00:27:23,557
How much did you spend?

333
00:27:24,729 --> 00:27:26,924
And that's all you got for $4?

334
00:27:27,765 --> 00:27:30,233
Peas and something to drink for $4?

335
00:27:30,501 --> 00:27:33,993
- What the heck is in that bag?
- It's those Chinese peas.

336
00:27:35,306 --> 00:27:36,637
They're not?

337
00:27:37,441 --> 00:27:38,965
They're Japanese?

338
00:27:39,143 --> 00:27:41,304
Chinese, Japanese. Same thing.

339
00:27:44,949 --> 00:27:46,109
Try one.

340
00:27:56,661 --> 00:27:59,755
Jesus Christ! Tastes like black pepper.

341
00:27:59,997 --> 00:28:01,464
Give me those.

342
00:28:02,533 --> 00:28:06,663
Little bastard. Did you see that?
He tried to fucking poison me.

343
00:28:06,838 --> 00:28:10,865
No, he didn't, Joe. Listen to me.
Those things are very expensive.

344
00:28:11,042 --> 00:28:13,806
They're like a delicacy. A refined taste.

345
00:28:14,111 --> 00:28:15,942
Refined taste, my ass.

346
00:28:20,351 --> 00:28:22,319
Jesus Christ, not again.

347
00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:26,647
I can't even light a fucking cigarette
around here without getting busted.

348
00:28:26,858 --> 00:28:29,486
You know something?
You really are a fucking moron.

349
00:28:29,694 --> 00:28:31,662
I'm gonna get to those
big tobacco companies...

350
00:28:31,829 --> 00:28:35,697
and I'm gonna thank them
when they put you in the fucking ground.

351
00:28:35,867 --> 00:28:40,133
And did I ever tell that you're like
a fucking wife that I don't need?

352
00:28:42,506 --> 00:28:44,804
Can't fucking enjoy a cigarette.

353
00:29:58,749 --> 00:30:01,741
Excuse me, miss.
Can I get you some more coffee?

354
00:30:04,622 --> 00:30:06,647
I really wish you hadn't done that.

355
00:30:06,824 --> 00:30:10,885
I had it the right color,
the right temperature. It was just right.

356
00:30:14,565 --> 00:30:15,657
Sorry.

357
00:31:02,046 --> 00:31:03,013
Hi.

358
00:31:07,051 --> 00:31:10,145
Sorry. Sorry about the coffee.

359
00:31:59,403 --> 00:32:02,861
- Does your name happen to be Gloria?
- No.

360
00:32:04,108 --> 00:32:08,545
'Cause I thought maybe you...
You're not friends with...

361
00:32:12,249 --> 00:32:13,375
Sorry.

362
00:32:48,586 --> 00:32:50,884
So can I get you something else?

363
00:32:51,288 --> 00:32:54,553
A sandwich? Something to eat
along with your coffee?

364
00:32:55,993 --> 00:32:59,759
It's not a very healthy lunch,
just the coffee and cigarettes.

365
00:32:59,964 --> 00:33:01,898
It's not my lunch, okay?

366
00:33:10,107 --> 00:33:11,233
Sorry.

367
00:35:11,729 --> 00:35:12,753
Alex.

368
00:35:13,964 --> 00:35:15,556
You startled me.

369
00:35:17,134 --> 00:35:18,897
How are you, Isaach?

370
00:35:19,603 --> 00:35:20,695
Okay?

371
00:35:24,541 --> 00:35:25,803
Very well.

372
00:35:27,044 --> 00:35:28,773
I'm happy to see you.

373
00:35:28,979 --> 00:35:32,244
I was so sick of being in Paris.
You can't imagine.

374
00:35:35,119 --> 00:35:36,313
Sit down.

375
00:35:43,260 --> 00:35:45,490
So, I was happy to get your call.

376
00:35:46,497 --> 00:35:49,091
So long time we didn't see each other.

377
00:35:51,435 --> 00:35:55,462
- I ordered you some coffee, okay?
- Yeah, sure. Thanks.

378
00:35:57,574 --> 00:35:59,439
So, everything is okay?

379
00:36:01,612 --> 00:36:04,479
Everything is okay. Very good.

380
00:36:05,816 --> 00:36:07,147
I am fine.

381
00:36:52,696 --> 00:36:55,893
So, are you sure that
everything is okay with you?

382
00:36:59,370 --> 00:37:01,031
Everything is okay.

383
00:37:03,240 --> 00:37:04,468
And you?

384
00:37:04,808 --> 00:37:07,402
Me? Things are okay.

385
00:37:07,978 --> 00:37:11,004
Not perfect, you know,
but pretty much okay.

386
00:37:12,082 --> 00:37:15,017
Good. I'm very happy to see you.

387
00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:18,311
I'm happy to see you, man.

388
00:37:36,240 --> 00:37:38,936
It's just that
since I didn't see you for so long...

389
00:37:39,109 --> 00:37:43,239
and you called to say you wanted to see me,
I thought maybe something was wrong.

390
00:37:43,414 --> 00:37:47,510
No. I just wanted to see you, that's all.

391
00:37:49,052 --> 00:37:51,612
Me too, man. I wanted to see you too.

392
00:38:03,434 --> 00:38:06,528
Are you sure there's nothing
you want to tell me?

393
00:38:06,703 --> 00:38:09,228
- Nothing bothering you?
- But why?

394
00:38:11,575 --> 00:38:14,874
- Do you want something to be wrong?
- Not at all.

395
00:38:15,779 --> 00:38:19,738
When I got your call, I had an intuition
that something was bothering you.

396
00:38:19,917 --> 00:38:23,375
Something maybe you need to talk about.
That's all, man.

397
00:38:23,954 --> 00:38:26,752
Isaach, there is nothing wrong.

398
00:38:27,891 --> 00:38:29,051
Really.

399
00:38:31,595 --> 00:38:32,619
Okay?

400
00:38:38,101 --> 00:38:39,500
Are you sure?

401
00:38:41,071 --> 00:38:42,902
Are you crazy, Isaach?

402
00:38:50,414 --> 00:38:52,678
Are you sure you have nothing...

403
00:38:53,150 --> 00:38:55,482
you know, to let out?

404
00:38:59,923 --> 00:39:02,118
Should I invent something bad?

405
00:39:02,493 --> 00:39:04,358
I could invent something bad for you.

406
00:39:04,528 --> 00:39:08,589
Not at all.
No. I don't want you to invent something.

407
00:39:09,166 --> 00:39:11,157
You know, I'm your best friend.

408
00:39:11,335 --> 00:39:14,133
You should feel completely free
to tell me the truth.

409
00:39:14,338 --> 00:39:17,136
To tell me whatever is bothering you.

410
00:39:18,108 --> 00:39:19,666
Cut the shit.

411
00:39:24,848 --> 00:39:28,375
Okay, I understand. That's cool.

412
00:39:30,521 --> 00:39:31,818
Thank you.

413
00:39:33,624 --> 00:39:34,955
No problem.

414
00:39:35,225 --> 00:39:37,716
Isaach, no problem.

415
00:40:03,086 --> 00:40:04,849
I guess I'm gonna go.

416
00:40:05,422 --> 00:40:07,856
Really? So soon?

417
00:40:09,259 --> 00:40:11,022
Yeah, you know, man...

418
00:40:11,194 --> 00:40:15,494
if you don't want to talk to me about it,
I don't want to be a problem.

419
00:40:17,434 --> 00:40:21,598
There is no problem, Isaach.
Don't you understand? No problem.

420
00:40:22,239 --> 00:40:25,333
I understand. But listen...

421
00:40:26,710 --> 00:40:30,043
if you don't want to talk now,
call me anytime, okay?

422
00:40:31,548 --> 00:40:34,915
Now maybe it's not the right time for you,
that's all.

423
00:40:53,937 --> 00:40:56,064
So, I was very happy to see you.

424
00:40:56,907 --> 00:40:58,772
Yes, me too.

425
00:40:59,910 --> 00:41:04,210
I'm sorry to disappoint you,
but there is nothing wrong. Really.

426
00:41:06,283 --> 00:41:07,614
It's okay.

427
00:41:09,286 --> 00:41:10,651
I do understand.

428
00:41:10,821 --> 00:41:13,585
No. You don't understand.

429
00:41:16,593 --> 00:41:17,753
Call me.

430
00:41:18,428 --> 00:41:19,952
See you, Isaach.

431
00:41:20,631 --> 00:41:21,791
Soon.

432
00:42:38,542 --> 00:42:42,000
- Hi, so nice to see you.
- You too.

433
00:42:42,212 --> 00:42:43,736
It's been ages.

434
00:42:46,883 --> 00:42:49,852
Last time, what?
A couple of years ago in Sydney, wasn't it?

435
00:42:50,053 --> 00:42:52,180
Really, was that two years ago?

436
00:42:53,890 --> 00:42:55,755
How are Jeff and Beryl?

437
00:42:55,992 --> 00:43:00,827
You know, same old, same old.
Still stuck in their odd little parental ways.

438
00:43:03,033 --> 00:43:06,400
So you're not with Mr. Cate and the baby
on this trip?

439
00:43:07,237 --> 00:43:11,401
No. Unfortunately, I'm by myself.
I'll see them next week.

440
00:43:15,612 --> 00:43:17,102
Everyone's good?

441
00:43:19,783 --> 00:43:21,751
Yeah, I want a baby.

442
00:43:23,186 --> 00:43:24,619
At some point.

443
00:43:26,256 --> 00:43:29,384
- What can I get for you?
- What are you having, Catie?

444
00:43:32,095 --> 00:43:35,121
Can I have an espresso, please?
In a large cup?

445
00:43:36,466 --> 00:43:39,299
Yeah, I'll have an espresso too, thanks.
A double.

446
00:43:39,469 --> 00:43:42,404
And can I have some hot milk on the side?
And could you heat it?

447
00:43:42,572 --> 00:43:45,234
- I think we can manage that.
- Thank you.

448
00:43:50,213 --> 00:43:53,740
I'm sorry I'm late.
I know you haven't got a lot of time.

449
00:43:55,118 --> 00:43:58,451
Don't worry about it.
I just wish I could stay here longer.

450
00:43:59,222 --> 00:44:03,090
Do you stay here overnight,
or do you just do your press stuff here?

451
00:44:03,260 --> 00:44:04,591
Your junket.

452
00:44:06,730 --> 00:44:10,257
No, I stay overnight
and I do the interviews here too.

453
00:44:10,433 --> 00:44:11,957
I just think it's easier.

454
00:44:12,135 --> 00:44:14,330
They do the interviews in my suite upstairs.

455
00:44:14,504 --> 00:44:16,904
They're setting up for the next interview...

456
00:44:17,073 --> 00:44:21,271
and I just thought maybe it would be nicer
if we met down here.

457
00:44:23,947 --> 00:44:26,677
No, thanks, Shell. You're not...

458
00:44:29,085 --> 00:44:30,245
Go on.

459
00:44:30,821 --> 00:44:33,449
They're not going to stop you smoking.

460
00:44:38,695 --> 00:44:40,856
- There you go, cous'.
- Thanks.

461
00:44:46,036 --> 00:44:48,834
So you mean they give you
this full-on hotel suite...

462
00:44:49,005 --> 00:44:51,667
and they also use it for your publicity?

463
00:44:53,877 --> 00:44:55,868
Seems kind of cheap.

464
00:44:56,880 --> 00:45:00,782
Well, it's a suite.
So they just divide up the room.

465
00:45:00,951 --> 00:45:02,816
Yeah, but why couldn't
they get you a suite...

466
00:45:03,019 --> 00:45:05,783
and get another suite to do your press in?

467
00:45:06,189 --> 00:45:08,987
It's pretty low-budget, this thing I did.

468
00:45:09,459 --> 00:45:10,858
Yeah, still.

469
00:45:12,562 --> 00:45:14,189
It's pretty cheap, man.

470
00:45:17,467 --> 00:45:18,991
Can I get you anything else?

471
00:45:19,202 --> 00:45:21,568
- No, thanks. That's great.
- You're welcome.

472
00:45:27,711 --> 00:45:30,839
Kind of weird getting in here.
I almost didn't...

473
00:45:32,916 --> 00:45:35,578
until they found out I was your cousin.

474
00:45:37,220 --> 00:45:40,917
There're some photographer,
paparazzi guys hanging out front.

475
00:45:41,925 --> 00:45:44,860
I guess they kind of
follow you around, right?

476
00:45:45,562 --> 00:45:49,396
You know, whatever so-called celebrities
are around, I suppose.

477
00:45:50,233 --> 00:45:54,033
God, that must be
a real fucking drag sometimes, right?

478
00:45:56,072 --> 00:45:57,835
I mean, not like me.

479
00:45:58,708 --> 00:45:59,868
I'm free.

480
00:46:00,410 --> 00:46:02,537
Practically broke, but I'm completely free.

481
00:46:02,712 --> 00:46:05,681
No one's stalking me,
that's for fucking sure.

482
00:46:07,250 --> 00:46:09,275
Except when they thought I was you.

483
00:46:09,920 --> 00:46:14,084
I got into this club once
because they thought I was you.

484
00:46:15,592 --> 00:46:18,720
Then they found out I wasn't
and asked me to leave.

485
00:46:18,929 --> 00:46:20,590
Pretty fucking rude.

486
00:46:22,899 --> 00:46:26,027
Don't get me wrong.
I mean, it must be fabulous. You got it all.

487
00:46:26,202 --> 00:46:28,295
You got a good husband, beautiful baby.

488
00:46:28,538 --> 00:46:31,530
Travel all over the world,
stay in fancy hotels.

489
00:46:32,809 --> 00:46:34,140
Parties...

490
00:46:34,945 --> 00:46:38,312
You know what they say,
the grass is always greener.

491
00:46:38,882 --> 00:46:40,474
So, how's...

492
00:46:42,619 --> 00:46:43,745
Shit.

493
00:46:44,287 --> 00:46:45,276
- Johnny.
- Who?

494
00:46:45,455 --> 00:46:47,423
Jimmy. Tommy. Sorry.

495
00:46:48,892 --> 00:46:50,154
How is he?

496
00:46:53,129 --> 00:46:55,495
We broke up almost two years ago.

497
00:46:57,300 --> 00:46:59,427
Tommy, yeah. What a dickhead.

498
00:47:01,171 --> 00:47:03,901
Got a new boyfriend now. Lee. Remember?

499
00:47:05,075 --> 00:47:07,509
He's in a band. Wrote you about him.

500
00:47:07,911 --> 00:47:10,402
He's a pretty huge part of my life.

501
00:47:11,281 --> 00:47:13,511
Sorry, Shell, I don't think you did.

502
00:47:13,683 --> 00:47:16,151
Yeah, I even sent you his fucking CD.

503
00:47:17,253 --> 00:47:20,188
Your assistant
probably didn't give it to you.

504
00:47:21,658 --> 00:47:25,788
It's okay. It's totally cool.
I mean, I know how busy your life is.

505
00:47:26,863 --> 00:47:29,696
- Do you remember where you sent it?
- No.

506
00:47:30,667 --> 00:47:33,135
I mean, one week you're in LA...

507
00:47:33,336 --> 00:47:35,304
then you're in London,
then you're in Sydney.

508
00:47:35,472 --> 00:47:39,340
I mean, you're in a different fucking city
every day of the week.

509
00:47:52,222 --> 00:47:55,988
I'd love to hear the music.
What does it sound like?

510
00:47:57,794 --> 00:47:59,227
It's really...

511
00:48:00,997 --> 00:48:02,487
kind of hard...

512
00:48:03,033 --> 00:48:05,831
and it's industrial, kind of throbbing...

513
00:48:09,472 --> 00:48:11,565
I don't think you'd get it.

514
00:48:15,011 --> 00:48:17,707
- What are they called?
- They're called SqC<rl.

515
00:48:18,548 --> 00:48:19,742
Squirrel.

516
00:48:19,983 --> 00:48:22,679
No, SqC<rl. You know, like they say it here.

517
00:48:22,852 --> 00:48:25,912
S-Q-U-R-L, with an umlaut
over the "U". SqC<rl.

518
00:48:27,424 --> 00:48:30,860
SqC<rl. I get it. Right.

519
00:48:31,227 --> 00:48:33,821
So can I buy the CD
until I find the one you sent?

520
00:48:33,997 --> 00:48:38,696
No, not yet. They recorded it independently,
you know, so...

521
00:48:39,202 --> 00:48:42,535
But I think the record company's
gonna put it out finally.

522
00:48:42,705 --> 00:48:43,865
I think.

523
00:48:48,878 --> 00:48:52,211
I'm gonna have to find that CD
so I can listen to it.

524
00:48:53,283 --> 00:48:55,251
You're not gonna find it.

525
00:48:55,418 --> 00:48:58,080
Shell, that isn't fair, actually.

526
00:48:58,721 --> 00:49:01,622
- It's true. You're not gonna find it.
- Really?

527
00:49:03,526 --> 00:49:07,553
I fucking know you're not.
'Cause I just remembered...

528
00:49:07,730 --> 00:49:10,927
I didn't actually send it to you.

529
00:49:11,101 --> 00:49:14,127
I think I just thought
about sending it to you.

530
00:49:30,587 --> 00:49:33,647
Almost forgot. This is for you.

531
00:49:34,791 --> 00:49:36,884
Thanks. What is it?

532
00:49:40,063 --> 00:49:43,590
This is really expensive stuff.
It must have cost hundreds.

533
00:49:47,971 --> 00:49:50,804
Cool, thanks. I could use this stuff.

534
00:49:52,308 --> 00:49:54,833
Make me look like a movie star, right?

535
00:49:58,448 --> 00:50:00,439
- Cheers.
- Cheers, gorgeous.

536
00:50:06,756 --> 00:50:09,919
Seriously, Catie, thanks for seeing me.

537
00:50:11,861 --> 00:50:13,852
No, thanks for seeing me.

538
00:50:16,332 --> 00:50:19,130
And thanks for all the fancy swag.

539
00:50:20,870 --> 00:50:22,303
It's nothing.

540
00:50:24,674 --> 00:50:26,437
It is swag, isn't it?

541
00:50:28,478 --> 00:50:31,038
They probably give you
all kinds of free stuff...

542
00:50:31,047 --> 00:50:32,708
jewelry, clothes.

543
00:50:33,449 --> 00:50:35,644
Probably give you cars, right?

544
00:50:35,952 --> 00:50:38,614
No, they don't give me cars.

545
00:50:39,689 --> 00:50:42,556
They sometimes give me makeup,
from time to time.

546
00:50:42,559 --> 00:50:44,618
But I just thought...

547
00:50:44,794 --> 00:50:47,126
I don't know, I just wanted...

548
00:50:47,297 --> 00:50:49,527
Didn't have time to go shopping.

549
00:50:49,866 --> 00:50:53,324
No, really, it's fine.
I mean, it's great. I can use it.

550
00:50:53,536 --> 00:50:56,232
It's just funny, don't you think?

551
00:50:56,406 --> 00:51:01,036
When you can't afford something,
it's really expensive.

552
00:51:01,044 --> 00:51:03,911
And then when you can afford it, it's free.

553
00:51:06,216 --> 00:51:08,650
Kind of backward, don't you think?

554
00:51:10,987 --> 00:51:14,354
The world's a bit like that, I guess,
in a lot of ways.

555
00:51:15,892 --> 00:51:17,757
Speaking of paparazzi...

556
00:51:17,994 --> 00:51:20,861
I saw these photos of you the other day
in the tabloids.

557
00:51:21,030 --> 00:51:23,225
Don't tell me that. Yuck.

558
00:51:24,400 --> 00:51:26,061
What was I wearing?

559
00:51:26,669 --> 00:51:27,693
Sorry.

560
00:51:29,706 --> 00:51:32,436
Hello? Hi, Lindsey.

561
00:51:35,111 --> 00:51:38,740
I'm downstairs, in the coffee room
with my cousin Shelly.

562
00:51:39,882 --> 00:51:41,406
It's already...

563
00:51:42,752 --> 00:51:46,779
Okay, yeah. I'll be up in a minute. Bye.

564
00:51:46,956 --> 00:51:48,548
- Got to get back to work?
- Yeah.

565
00:51:48,725 --> 00:51:50,283
Back to the grind?

566
00:51:52,862 --> 00:51:54,523
Do you want to come up to the room?

567
00:51:54,530 --> 00:51:57,795
It won't be very interesting,
but you're welcome to come up.

568
00:51:57,800 --> 00:52:00,860
What, and watch you do TV interviews
and stuff?

569
00:52:01,104 --> 00:52:03,129
Like Entertainment Tonight?

570
00:52:12,949 --> 00:52:16,715
Maybe you can send me that CD,
or a letter, or something.

571
00:52:16,886 --> 00:52:21,414
- Yeah, but you wouldn't read it.
- Stop it. I would if you actually sent it.

572
00:52:25,161 --> 00:52:27,425
I've really gotta go. Sorry.

573
00:52:28,898 --> 00:52:31,594
It was great seeing you.
Have you got my numbers?

574
00:52:36,973 --> 00:52:39,601
Take care. Send my love to everyone.

575
00:52:43,012 --> 00:52:45,845
Yeah, send my love to everyone
on your end.

576
00:52:50,653 --> 00:52:52,587
If they even remember me.

577
00:52:52,755 --> 00:52:54,780
- Bye, Catie.
- See you, Shell.

578
00:52:55,992 --> 00:52:58,984
Put that on my room
and anything else she wants.

579
00:52:59,162 --> 00:53:02,029
- Maybe next time I'll get to meet Lou.
- Yeah.

580
00:53:03,466 --> 00:53:04,660
It's Lee.

581
00:53:13,109 --> 00:53:14,440
Excuse me.

582
00:53:16,646 --> 00:53:19,547
Can I have a tequila?
Thanks, a double, and the menu.

583
00:53:19,716 --> 00:53:22,651
I'm sorry, there's no smoking in the lounge.

584
00:55:13,629 --> 00:55:16,894
So, Jack, you going to tell me
about your tesla coil?

585
00:55:17,800 --> 00:55:20,098
You said you didn't want to hear about it.

586
00:55:20,269 --> 00:55:22,931
Yeah, but that was a while ago.

587
00:55:24,507 --> 00:55:27,169
I don't know if I want to talk about it.

588
00:55:29,946 --> 00:55:31,277
Come on, Jack.

589
00:55:31,447 --> 00:55:34,439
You dragged it all the way down here
in your little red wagon.

590
00:55:34,617 --> 00:55:36,778
Come on, just tell me about it.

591
00:55:40,656 --> 00:55:45,116
I built it based on the inventor
Nikola Tesla's original designs.

592
00:55:46,329 --> 00:55:48,263
It's an air transformer...

593
00:55:48,498 --> 00:55:52,161
with primary and secondary coils
that are tuned to resonate.

594
00:55:52,869 --> 00:55:55,667
It's basically a step-up transformer...

595
00:55:55,838 --> 00:56:00,138
which converts relatively low-voltage
high current to high-voltage low current...

596
00:56:00,343 --> 00:56:02,004
at high frequencies.

597
00:56:03,880 --> 00:56:05,313
Do you remember...

598
00:56:05,515 --> 00:56:09,349
when we were kids,
you had a little Barbie makeup mirror?

599
00:56:09,952 --> 00:56:11,817
Yeah, I remember that.

600
00:56:12,288 --> 00:56:14,813
It had a little fluorescent light on it?

601
00:56:15,791 --> 00:56:18,453
Nikola Tesla invented fluorescent light.

602
00:56:19,295 --> 00:56:22,025
Without him,
we wouldn't have alternating current...

603
00:56:22,198 --> 00:56:25,827
radio, television, x-ray technology...

604
00:56:26,836 --> 00:56:30,499
induction motors, particle beams, lasers.

605
00:56:30,740 --> 00:56:33,903
None of that would even exist,
if it weren't for him.

606
00:56:34,143 --> 00:56:36,008
Or the rock band, Tesla.

607
00:56:39,248 --> 00:56:40,340
Funny.

608
00:56:42,752 --> 00:56:44,686
Tesla was a true genius.

609
00:56:45,254 --> 00:56:49,884
If we had paid more attention to his ideas,
the world would be a much better place.

610
00:56:50,059 --> 00:56:53,187
We'd have free mass communication,
free transportation...

611
00:56:53,396 --> 00:56:54,920
free energy for everyone.

612
00:56:55,097 --> 00:56:58,760
That's why they discredited him in the end.
For free energy.

613
00:57:00,903 --> 00:57:04,703
He perceived the Earth
as a conductor of acoustical resonance.

614
00:57:09,011 --> 00:57:10,911
What a beautiful idea.

615
00:57:14,951 --> 00:57:18,250
So, Jack, are you going to show me
how the coil works?

616
00:57:19,622 --> 00:57:21,214
Yeah, all right.

617
00:57:24,427 --> 00:57:26,054
You'll need these.

618
00:57:54,290 --> 00:57:56,758
- All right, you ready, Meg?
- I'm ready.

619
00:58:27,990 --> 00:58:30,117
Damn it. Something went wrong.

620
00:58:31,594 --> 00:58:33,289
It was cool, though.

621
00:58:34,296 --> 00:58:37,629
Yeah, but it wasn't supposed to stop.
It was supposed to keep working.

622
00:58:37,800 --> 00:58:39,665
I don't know what happened.

623
00:58:39,835 --> 00:58:42,269
I think maybe you blew a capacitor?

624
00:58:42,638 --> 00:58:45,038
No, I didn't blow a capacitor, Meg.

625
00:58:48,110 --> 00:58:49,975
Maybe it tripped your GFI.

626
00:58:50,646 --> 00:58:52,978
Yeah, your Ground Fault Interrupter.

627
00:58:53,182 --> 00:58:56,481
Yeah, I know what a GFI is.
That's not what happened.

628
00:58:57,787 --> 00:58:59,618
You don't have to snap at me.

629
00:59:15,204 --> 00:59:19,834
I think maybe the spark gaps
are too far apart on your spark coil vibrator.

630
00:59:29,218 --> 00:59:31,049
Yeah, that could be it.

631
00:59:32,655 --> 00:59:33,815
I guess.

632
00:59:37,660 --> 00:59:39,525
Yeah, it is. That's it.

633
00:59:40,563 --> 00:59:43,862
You're right about that.
I didn't check that earlier.

634
00:59:57,012 --> 00:59:59,503
I'm gonna go home and check it out.

635
01:00:01,383 --> 01:00:04,079
- Are you going to go bowling tomorrow?
- Yeah, I'll be there.

636
01:00:04,286 --> 01:00:06,379
All right, I'll see you there.

637
01:00:54,136 --> 01:00:57,003
Earth as a conductor
of acoustical resonance.

638
01:01:19,795 --> 01:01:22,127
Hello, who is this?

639
01:01:22,698 --> 01:01:25,963
Laura. Hi, this is Alfred Molina
for Steve Coogan.

640
01:01:30,673 --> 01:01:32,698
M-O-L-I-N-A.

641
01:01:35,044 --> 01:01:36,602
The actor, yes.

642
01:01:38,480 --> 01:01:41,142
I was just double-checking that Steve...

643
01:01:41,450 --> 01:01:43,645
He is. Great, okay.

644
01:01:43,953 --> 01:01:46,478
Just in case you need it,
my cell phone number...

645
01:01:46,689 --> 01:01:47,781
Hello?

646
01:01:58,133 --> 01:02:00,624
- Hello, Alfred.
- Steve, hello.

647
01:02:01,537 --> 01:02:04,904
Hi. I'm so glad you could make it.
Please sit down.

648
01:02:05,574 --> 01:02:09,874
I was just talking to Laura, your assistant,
seeing if you were on your way here.

649
01:02:10,045 --> 01:02:11,512
- I'm here.
- Fantastic.

650
01:02:11,680 --> 01:02:14,308
I took the liberty of ordering some tea.

651
01:02:15,050 --> 01:02:16,517
Shall I be mother?

652
01:02:17,052 --> 01:02:19,543
That's okay, I'll be my own mother.

653
01:02:19,989 --> 01:02:21,854
Some milk there for you.

654
01:02:23,192 --> 01:02:24,352
Real tea.

655
01:02:26,061 --> 01:02:27,255
It's hard to come by.

656
01:02:27,429 --> 01:02:32,025
I have this fantasy where if I ever won
a Golden Globe or an Academy Award...

657
01:02:32,201 --> 01:02:36,661
I'd use the opportunity to tell the Yanks
how to make a decent cup of tea.

658
01:02:38,107 --> 01:02:40,667
- Here's to a good cup of tea.
- Cheers.

659
01:02:45,581 --> 01:02:48,049
I love your coat.

660
01:02:48,918 --> 01:02:50,852
Yeah, it's Viv Westwood.

661
01:02:53,722 --> 01:02:56,350
I've got a weakness for British designers.

662
01:02:56,525 --> 01:02:58,686
I don't know what it is
about American designers.

663
01:02:58,861 --> 01:03:01,091
They're just too safe.

664
01:03:02,431 --> 01:03:06,390
Aren't you going to be a little bit warm?
It's about 85 outside.

665
01:03:07,436 --> 01:03:09,904
No, I take it off when I go out.

666
01:03:10,706 --> 01:03:13,072
It's just the air conditioning.

667
01:03:20,282 --> 01:03:24,912
- So how long have you been living in LA?
- We've been here about seven years.

668
01:03:25,454 --> 01:03:27,046
We love it here.

669
01:03:28,791 --> 01:03:30,486
I do love visiting LA.

670
01:03:30,659 --> 01:03:35,255
But I always say, it's a great place to visit,
it's an even nicer place to leave.

671
01:03:37,433 --> 01:03:38,764
The palm trees...

672
01:03:39,134 --> 01:03:41,659
Palm trees annoy the fuck out of me.

673
01:03:42,471 --> 01:03:45,406
It's not for everybody. I like it here.

674
01:03:45,574 --> 01:03:48,634
I came out here for the work and stuff.

675
01:03:51,981 --> 01:03:54,609
It's great to finally meet you.

676
01:03:54,917 --> 01:03:57,852
I've got to say I'm a huge fan of your stuff...

677
01:03:58,020 --> 01:04:00,284
all the stuff you've done on TV,
the comedy stuff.

678
01:04:00,489 --> 01:04:05,290
I've got all the tapes.
I get them sent over. It's fantastic.

679
01:04:05,995 --> 01:04:07,292
Thank you.

680
01:04:13,702 --> 01:04:17,661
Likewise, I'm certainly very aware of you.

681
01:04:18,007 --> 01:04:19,201
Great.

682
01:04:21,844 --> 01:04:24,472
I saw that TV series you did.

683
01:04:25,714 --> 01:04:27,272
Yeah, you saw that?

684
01:04:27,616 --> 01:04:29,641
Yeah. Interesting.

685
01:04:31,286 --> 01:04:33,811
- We got canceled.
- Yeah, I heard that.

686
01:04:35,324 --> 01:04:37,622
Comedy's such a difficult thing.

687
01:04:43,532 --> 01:04:48,333
Your career seems to be going terribly well.
You've got a lot of heat at the moment.

688
01:04:51,040 --> 01:04:52,701
Is that why you're here?

689
01:04:52,908 --> 01:04:57,174
The merry-go-round of meetings. It's nice.

690
01:04:57,379 --> 01:05:01,839
People are finally starting
to take a bit of notice, which is great.

691
01:05:02,051 --> 01:05:04,679
- Are you meeting on anything interesting?
- Yeah.

692
01:05:13,829 --> 01:05:18,528
I've got to say you were just fantastic...

693
01:05:18,734 --> 01:05:23,603
in 24 Hour. No, seriously,
24 Hour Party People was just a knockout.

694
01:05:23,605 --> 01:05:26,506
- I mean, brilliant. Great work.
- Thank you.

695
01:05:27,242 --> 01:05:29,267
Really brilliant. It was...

696
01:05:30,846 --> 01:05:32,438
And the reviews...

697
01:05:32,948 --> 01:05:35,212
They were pretty fucking great.

698
01:05:35,417 --> 01:05:38,045
I was amazed because it was...

699
01:05:38,220 --> 01:05:41,712
I didn't think many people would get
all the cultural references.

700
01:05:41,890 --> 01:05:44,791
Sort of, Manchester, early '80s,
the whole music scene.

701
01:05:44,960 --> 01:05:46,086
You'd be surprised.

702
01:05:46,295 --> 01:05:50,459
But a lot of people didn't have any kind
of reference to make to it because...

703
01:05:50,933 --> 01:05:53,060
They know about the bands over here...

704
01:05:53,235 --> 01:05:57,399
but the whole thing, your character,
and his running the TV show...

705
01:05:57,606 --> 01:05:59,403
Do you want a cigarette?

706
01:05:59,575 --> 01:06:02,408
- Sorry, they're French.
- No, that's okay. Thanks.

707
01:06:09,051 --> 01:06:10,916
I'll save it for later.

708
01:06:12,921 --> 01:06:13,945
Okay.

709
01:06:23,799 --> 01:06:27,098
So, Laura said that...

710
01:06:28,770 --> 01:06:33,230
you were really keen to meeting.
She wouldn't tell me what it was.

711
01:06:33,408 --> 01:06:36,935
I didn't want to say it over the phone
because it would've sounded weird.

712
01:06:37,146 --> 01:06:40,172
I can imagine how she thought.
This was coming out of nowhere.

713
01:06:40,182 --> 01:06:42,343
I phone her up,
and she doesn't know me from Adam.

714
01:06:42,518 --> 01:06:45,282
I said, "I must talk to Steve Coogan".

715
01:06:45,487 --> 01:06:47,182
But I wanted to see you in person.

716
01:06:47,356 --> 01:06:49,517
When I found out you'd be here
for a few days...

717
01:06:49,758 --> 01:06:52,454
I thought this was the perfect opportunity
to let you know...

718
01:06:52,661 --> 01:06:55,357
Anyway, I'll get right to it.

719
01:06:56,498 --> 01:06:58,591
I'm so excited about this.

720
01:06:59,501 --> 01:07:01,594
Let me try and put it in context.

721
01:07:04,006 --> 01:07:06,668
I've always had a big passion for history...

722
01:07:06,842 --> 01:07:08,833
and people's lives...

723
01:07:09,011 --> 01:07:13,812
and all the little events
of how you get from A to B...

724
01:07:14,716 --> 01:07:17,344
and all the small details in people's lives...

725
01:07:17,519 --> 01:07:20,852
that are kind of really full of epic qualities.

726
01:07:21,390 --> 01:07:24,359
So I've been doing all this research and...

727
01:07:27,563 --> 01:07:29,030
I've come up with this.

728
01:07:29,198 --> 01:07:32,690
And what state is...
Is it greenlit or is it just a treatment?

729
01:07:32,868 --> 01:07:34,392
What stage is it?

730
01:07:35,637 --> 01:07:38,197
I'm sorry. God, it's so embarrassing.

731
01:07:38,407 --> 01:07:42,138
It's not some... This isn't work.
It's got nothing to do with work.

732
01:07:42,311 --> 01:07:44,074
It's not a project.

733
01:07:44,246 --> 01:07:48,205
I did some genealogical research,
and I came across...

734
01:07:48,684 --> 01:07:49,981
What I discovered was...

735
01:07:50,152 --> 01:07:51,847
- Mr. Coogan?
- Yes?

736
01:07:52,020 --> 01:07:53,715
- It is you, isn't it?
- It is, yes.

737
01:07:53,722 --> 01:07:56,919
- I'm such a huge fan.
- You're not that huge.

738
01:07:58,360 --> 01:08:00,089
Only where it counts.

739
01:08:01,063 --> 01:08:04,191
- Could I bother you for an autograph?
- Absolutely.

740
01:08:04,433 --> 01:08:06,663
- Great.
- I've been recognized.

741
01:08:07,069 --> 01:08:08,764
Where do you want it?

742
01:08:09,338 --> 01:08:12,830
- Paper is fine.
- Spoilsport.

743
01:08:14,376 --> 01:08:16,367
- No, don't do that.
- Sorry.

744
01:08:16,578 --> 01:08:19,547
- I probably have something in my bag.
- Okay.

745
01:08:20,015 --> 01:08:22,040
Just give me a second here.

746
01:08:23,385 --> 01:08:24,545
Oh, gosh.

747
01:08:25,053 --> 01:08:27,044
- I'm so sorry.
- That's all right.

748
01:08:28,423 --> 01:08:31,017
- Give me one more minute.
- Take your time.

749
01:08:31,193 --> 01:08:35,186
- Here, please, in there.
- Okay, and what's your name?

750
01:08:35,397 --> 01:08:36,455
Katy.

751
01:08:37,366 --> 01:08:39,391
- With a "Y".
- All right.

752
01:08:39,868 --> 01:08:41,460
What Katy did next.

753
01:08:42,471 --> 01:08:45,201
- Hello.
- Alfred's an actor too.

754
01:08:48,043 --> 01:08:50,238
- Here.
- Thank you. Great.

755
01:08:52,247 --> 01:08:54,807
- Thank you very much.
- You're welcome.

756
01:09:00,989 --> 01:09:03,423
- Wow.
- Let's get back to this.

757
01:09:03,592 --> 01:09:06,584
I don't want to take up too much
of your time. I know you're busy.

758
01:09:06,762 --> 01:09:09,663
As I said, I did this genealogical research...

759
01:09:09,898 --> 01:09:13,834
I was just doing it for my own interest.
I wasn't looking for anything specific.

760
01:09:13,835 --> 01:09:15,769
I just came across this.

761
01:09:16,638 --> 01:09:19,766
I'll cut a long story short.

762
01:09:20,242 --> 01:09:21,402
Steve Coogan.

763
01:09:22,477 --> 01:09:24,069
Drum roll.

764
01:09:26,148 --> 01:09:27,979
The thing is, Steve...

765
01:09:28,984 --> 01:09:31,680
you and I are cousins.

766
01:09:35,657 --> 01:09:38,626
How do you mean? You mean artistically?

767
01:09:38,960 --> 01:09:43,795
No, I mean in the normal way.
We're cousins. We're related.

768
01:09:47,369 --> 01:09:50,361
- It's amazing, isn't it?
- Yeah. Are you sure?

769
01:09:50,372 --> 01:09:52,636
The way it works out is this, look...

770
01:09:53,041 --> 01:09:55,532
My great-great grandfather...

771
01:09:56,478 --> 01:09:58,503
is your great-great uncle.

772
01:09:58,680 --> 01:10:03,674
And further back, we shared
the same great-great-great grandfather.

773
01:10:06,188 --> 01:10:09,157
My ancestry is Irish,
but I knew there was an Italian...

774
01:10:09,358 --> 01:10:11,724
That's it. The Italian connection is...

775
01:10:11,893 --> 01:10:15,021
the great-great-great-great grandfather,
Giuseppe.

776
01:10:15,530 --> 01:10:18,124
- Isn't that amazing?
- Yeah, this is...

777
01:10:18,367 --> 01:10:19,994
This is a lot of detail.

778
01:10:20,202 --> 01:10:23,399
- It's my thing, I kind of do a little...
- Amazing.

779
01:10:23,572 --> 01:10:27,838
I think it's just great to be able to say
that I'm related to Steve Coogan.

780
01:10:28,043 --> 01:10:32,002
Likewise, I can tell people
I'm related to Albert Molina.

781
01:10:32,214 --> 01:10:33,340
Alfred.

782
01:10:36,818 --> 01:10:40,015
It's my grandmother who's the big one
on the family tree.

783
01:10:40,188 --> 01:10:41,485
She'll be very thrilled.

784
01:10:41,690 --> 01:10:45,057
She's a huge fan of your work.
She loved you in...

785
01:10:48,230 --> 01:10:49,424
Boogie Nights.

786
01:10:49,598 --> 01:10:52,066
Right, with the shorts and the shotgun?

787
01:10:52,234 --> 01:10:54,532
Yeah, she talked about that once.

788
01:10:55,170 --> 01:10:56,398
Great.

789
01:10:56,605 --> 01:11:00,564
I know this is coming right out of the blue,
but just think of the possibilities.

790
01:11:00,742 --> 01:11:03,040
It's fantastic. Let's look at the facts.

791
01:11:03,211 --> 01:11:07,580
We're both actors.
We're cousins, we've established that.

792
01:11:08,683 --> 01:11:11,846
We could maybe work together,
do a play maybe.

793
01:11:12,020 --> 01:11:14,011
We could make a movie.

794
01:11:14,189 --> 01:11:16,783
We could actually do a movie
about this story.

795
01:11:16,958 --> 01:11:20,450
About discovering this amazing thing
between us, that we're cousins.

796
01:11:20,462 --> 01:11:22,362
The story could be two actors...

797
01:11:22,531 --> 01:11:26,399
who discover that they're cousins.
We can actually play ourselves.

798
01:11:26,601 --> 01:11:30,264
We'd be in the movie.
I'd be Fred Molina, you'd be Steve...

799
01:11:30,439 --> 01:11:32,907
We'd be cousins in the movie.

800
01:11:33,942 --> 01:11:37,378
It's fantastic. It'd be great, absolutely great.

801
01:11:39,114 --> 01:11:43,414
You know, or not. We could just hang out.

802
01:11:43,618 --> 01:11:46,746
We should definitely go
for a beer sometime. That'd be great.

803
01:11:46,955 --> 01:11:50,755
Maybe go on vacation together,
just the two of us...

804
01:11:51,426 --> 01:11:53,621
sort of get to know each other.

805
01:11:59,968 --> 01:12:01,833
You're not gay are you?

806
01:12:02,471 --> 01:12:03,495
No.

807
01:12:04,105 --> 01:12:05,663
No, I'm married.

808
01:12:05,974 --> 01:12:07,839
So was James I.

809
01:12:08,810 --> 01:12:12,143
Sorry. I don't know,
that just popped into my head.

810
01:12:12,314 --> 01:12:15,283
- Say it, get it out of the way.
- I understand.

811
01:12:15,784 --> 01:12:17,411
I know exactly what you're thinking.

812
01:12:17,419 --> 01:12:19,649
If somebody came up to me going,
I'm your cousin...

813
01:12:19,821 --> 01:12:21,948
I'd think they were a nutter as well.

814
01:12:22,157 --> 01:12:23,624
Take it from me, I'm not crazy.

815
01:12:23,792 --> 01:12:28,092
I just think
this is a fantastic, extraordinary...

816
01:12:28,797 --> 01:12:31,197
- Delightful thing for me.
- Absolutely.

817
01:12:31,366 --> 01:12:34,028
- And I just wanted you to know about it.
- Ditto.

818
01:12:34,469 --> 01:12:36,767
All I want, if I want anything...

819
01:12:36,938 --> 01:12:41,466
is for you to just acknowledge
this extraordinary thing...

820
01:12:44,145 --> 01:12:46,204
and just love me.

821
01:12:54,556 --> 01:12:56,649
Yeah, I could do that.

822
01:13:08,537 --> 01:13:12,200
I have to go.

823
01:13:13,542 --> 01:13:16,511
I didn't tell you. I have this meeting.

824
01:13:16,711 --> 01:13:18,736
- It actually moved forward.
- I see.

825
01:13:18,914 --> 01:13:23,078
It's at Universal.
Number crunchers, financiers...

826
01:13:30,892 --> 01:13:32,416
- This...
- That's for you.

827
01:13:32,594 --> 01:13:34,562
- That's great.
- It's yours.

828
01:13:36,765 --> 01:13:40,531
- I'll make sure that gets filed.
- Sure.

829
01:13:41,570 --> 01:13:43,561
You'll be here a couple of days, right?

830
01:13:43,738 --> 01:13:46,366
So maybe we could see each other
before you go.

831
01:13:47,542 --> 01:13:49,908
Just checking the mental diary...

832
01:13:55,584 --> 01:13:59,418
This is not good, the time I'm here.

833
01:13:59,688 --> 01:14:01,781
- It's just that it's packed.
- I understand.

834
01:14:01,957 --> 01:14:02,889
No problem.

835
01:14:03,091 --> 01:14:06,891
Give me your cell phone number,
and I'll call you before you go.

836
01:14:07,062 --> 01:14:08,791
There's a story there.

837
01:14:09,264 --> 01:14:12,062
There's a tri-band system
here in the States...

838
01:14:12,233 --> 01:14:15,100
which is different to the system in the UK...

839
01:14:15,270 --> 01:14:17,067
and it's a kind of...

840
01:14:17,572 --> 01:14:21,565
The cell phones, they don't work here.
So I'm kind of cell phone-less...

841
01:14:21,743 --> 01:14:23,870
- in the US.
- I see.

842
01:14:24,946 --> 01:14:27,540
Well, give me your home number.
I'll call you.

843
01:14:27,716 --> 01:14:29,741
- You've got my PA's number, right?
- Yeah.

844
01:14:29,951 --> 01:14:32,044
Great, then we're connected.

845
01:14:32,320 --> 01:14:34,982
Can't you give me your number at home?

846
01:14:37,826 --> 01:14:39,293
Can I say no?

847
01:14:39,794 --> 01:14:44,561
Because nothing,
absolutely nothing personal...

848
01:14:44,733 --> 01:14:49,466
It's just that I never
give my number out, ever.

849
01:14:49,638 --> 01:14:51,606
It's just a personal space thing.

850
01:14:51,773 --> 01:14:55,937
It's just a rule and I always think,
stick to the rule.

851
01:14:56,745 --> 01:14:59,407
It's more of a philosophy than a rule.

852
01:15:02,617 --> 01:15:06,451
I've not given my number out
to many eminent people in the past.

853
01:15:06,621 --> 01:15:08,987
I once didn't give my number
to Sam Mendes.

854
01:15:09,157 --> 01:15:11,125
So you're in good company.

855
01:15:13,762 --> 01:15:17,425
If it's good enough for Sam Mendes,
it's good enough for me.

856
01:15:22,937 --> 01:15:25,872
- I think it's me.
- Right, because mine doesn't work.

857
01:15:26,041 --> 01:15:28,771
I'm sorry, I got to take this. I'll get back.

858
01:15:29,611 --> 01:15:30,600
Hello?

859
01:15:32,047 --> 01:15:33,480
Yeah, sure.

860
01:15:35,850 --> 01:15:39,115
Spike, hi. How you doing?

861
01:15:39,521 --> 01:15:41,318
You got the message.

862
01:15:41,489 --> 01:15:45,687
My agent just called you just to make sure
we're all on the same page.

863
01:15:46,528 --> 01:15:51,227
No, the producer credit is just so you and I
can sort of keep tabs on everything.

864
01:15:51,399 --> 01:15:53,663
You know, artistic integrity,
that sort of thing.

865
01:15:53,835 --> 01:15:56,702
Otherwise the whole thing
could just run away.

866
01:15:59,674 --> 01:16:01,665
You bastard, no.

867
01:16:02,844 --> 01:16:03,868
All right.

868
01:16:04,045 --> 01:16:06,707
You still okay for Sunday? Good. All right.

869
01:16:06,915 --> 01:16:09,850
Will I meet you there?
All right. Nice and early.

870
01:16:10,018 --> 01:16:13,249
Okay, yeah. Lots of love. Bye, Spike.

871
01:16:14,823 --> 01:16:17,348
- I'm sorry about that.
- It's okay, fine.

872
01:16:20,895 --> 01:16:22,988
Was that Spike Lee?

873
01:16:23,164 --> 01:16:27,260
No. I don't even know Spike Lee.
That was Spike Jonze.

874
01:16:29,170 --> 01:16:31,934
- I love him.
- Yeah, he's a good man.

875
01:16:32,574 --> 01:16:35,771
We've been friends for a long time now.

876
01:16:36,044 --> 01:16:38,205
We're both keen hikers.

877
01:16:38,713 --> 01:16:41,409
- Well, it's very boring.
- No, go on.

878
01:16:41,950 --> 01:16:46,046
We belong to a club,
and we go hiking at weekends.

879
01:16:46,454 --> 01:16:50,584
He's a very committed environmentalist.

880
01:16:50,925 --> 01:16:54,884
Spike Jonze is a tree-hugger.
Jesus, I never had him down as that.

881
01:16:58,867 --> 01:17:01,961
I think he prefers the term "leaf people"...

882
01:17:02,804 --> 01:17:04,237
as do I.

883
01:17:07,642 --> 01:17:11,738
Right, I mean, that's...
Don't get me wrong. That's great.

884
01:17:12,914 --> 01:17:17,078
I love trees.
I think there should be more of them.

885
01:17:18,286 --> 01:17:20,777
When I use paper, I use both sides.

886
01:17:22,457 --> 01:17:24,118
I would love to...

887
01:17:29,664 --> 01:17:32,497
You know, I'm going to tear up...

888
01:17:32,500 --> 01:17:35,833
that stupid rule about phone numbers.

889
01:17:36,805 --> 01:17:38,432
It's such shit.

890
01:17:40,742 --> 01:17:43,939
Would it be shabby of me
to give you my number now?

891
01:17:47,148 --> 01:17:48,080
Yeah.

892
01:17:58,092 --> 01:18:00,652
I've got to go. I'm so sorry.

893
01:18:03,364 --> 01:18:05,696
- I'll get the check.
- Good.

894
01:18:19,681 --> 01:18:20,807
Fuck.

895
01:18:58,186 --> 01:19:00,677
Damn RZA. Where the fuck you at?

896
01:19:13,868 --> 01:19:16,063
- Yo, peace.
- Bobby.

897
01:19:20,008 --> 01:19:21,873
- Pardon me for being late.
- Ain't nothing.

898
01:19:22,043 --> 01:19:26,173
- I was about to hit you on the horn.
- I had a fucking emergency house call, yo.

899
01:19:26,180 --> 01:19:28,375
- A house call?
- Yeah, a house call.

900
01:19:29,050 --> 01:19:32,884
Sophia and Sifu's children got sick
with the flu and the virus.

901
01:19:33,254 --> 01:19:36,223
So I went by,
prescribed some herbal medicines for them.

902
01:19:36,424 --> 01:19:39,689
I told them, lay off the dairy products,
chill on the citric acid...

903
01:19:39,861 --> 01:19:41,954
and they should feel a little better.

904
01:19:42,196 --> 01:19:46,132
- So you a doctor now, or something?
- Yeah, I told you.

905
01:19:46,301 --> 01:19:49,429
I've been studying alternative medicine
for two years now, son.

906
01:19:49,437 --> 01:19:52,463
I mean, ancient healing techniques,
and all that.

907
01:19:52,640 --> 01:19:53,732
Check this.

908
01:19:53,942 --> 01:19:58,106
I even know a certain surgical procedure
that I can perform using a drill-gun.

909
01:19:58,379 --> 01:19:59,778
Electric drill-gun.

910
01:20:00,481 --> 01:20:01,778
I'm dead serious.

911
01:20:01,950 --> 01:20:05,386
But my hands are nice from being a DJ,
you know what I mean?

912
01:20:05,586 --> 01:20:08,384
To me, music and medicine, all go together.

913
01:20:08,556 --> 01:20:11,150
It's like two planets
revolving around the same sun.

914
01:20:11,159 --> 01:20:12,217
So bong-bong.

915
01:20:12,393 --> 01:20:14,054
- Want some tea?
- Yeah, splash me.

916
01:20:14,228 --> 01:20:16,389
It's all herbals, man. No caffeine.

917
01:20:16,564 --> 01:20:20,557
That's what I'm talking about. No caffeine.
Caffeine is ridiculous right now, man.

918
01:20:20,735 --> 01:20:22,168
Tell me about it.

919
01:20:22,337 --> 01:20:25,067
Caffeine leads to depression...

920
01:20:25,473 --> 01:20:28,670
makes you all irritable,
have your heart beating fast.

921
01:20:28,910 --> 01:20:30,673
Faster heart rate, you know what I mean?

922
01:20:30,845 --> 01:20:34,281
And worse than anything,
you drink that coffee, it gives you the shits.

923
01:20:34,482 --> 01:20:37,645
You know what I mean?
So I try to stay away from that.

924
01:20:37,819 --> 01:20:41,277
- I'm off that shit, anyway.
- Crisp and clean. No caffeine.

925
01:20:41,823 --> 01:20:45,691
- To Liquid Swords, family.
- No, to Bobby Digital.

926
01:20:45,860 --> 01:20:48,192
- Wu-Tang forever.
- Wu-Tang forever.

927
01:20:50,131 --> 01:20:51,962
Anybody need more coffee?

928
01:20:52,166 --> 01:20:54,657
- Kitchen's closing.
- No, we don't mess with caffeine.

929
01:20:54,836 --> 01:20:56,804
- You don't?
- No, I don't.

930
01:20:57,171 --> 01:20:59,639
Don't you know caffeine
can cause serious delirium?

931
01:20:59,807 --> 01:21:01,832
- Delirium?
- Serious delirium.

932
01:21:02,010 --> 01:21:03,602
Now you tell me.

933
01:21:04,612 --> 01:21:06,978
Well, that may be my problem, delirium.

934
01:21:11,686 --> 01:21:13,677
Aren't you Bill Murray, man?

935
01:21:14,389 --> 01:21:17,381
- You're Bill Murray?
- Yeah, I'm Bill Murray...

936
01:21:17,558 --> 01:21:20,459
but let's keep that just between us, all right?

937
01:21:22,163 --> 01:21:23,528
Just between us.

938
01:21:25,900 --> 01:21:28,698
And you guys are related?

939
01:21:29,537 --> 01:21:31,505
Yeah, we're cousins. We're family.

940
01:21:31,672 --> 01:21:35,039
No, you're messing with me
because you're both troublemakers.

941
01:21:35,743 --> 01:21:38,177
- Troublemakers?
- The Wu-Tang Clan.

942
01:21:38,346 --> 01:21:40,007
Right, Wu-Tang Clan.

943
01:21:40,715 --> 01:21:42,979
- You're GZA, the genius.
- That's right.

944
01:21:43,151 --> 01:21:45,676
- And you're RZA...
- A.k.a...

945
01:21:47,655 --> 01:21:51,022
- Bobby Digital.
- Yeah, he knows hip-hop.

946
01:21:51,225 --> 01:21:53,022
And you're Bill Murray.

947
01:21:53,394 --> 01:21:57,763
Bill "Groundhog-Day-Ghostbusting-Ass" Murray.

948
01:21:57,765 --> 01:22:00,859
- Who ya gonna call?
- I know that. Just don't tell anybody.

949
01:22:01,069 --> 01:22:03,230
What you mean, don't tell anybody,
Bill Murray?

950
01:22:03,404 --> 01:22:06,896
People will come here, they'll see you.
You're Bill Murray. It's obvious.

951
01:22:07,075 --> 01:22:09,669
Unless you're wearing a disguise
or something.

952
01:22:10,845 --> 01:22:12,836
I am wearing kind of a disguise.

953
01:22:14,782 --> 01:22:16,773
Damn, that's harsh, money.

954
01:22:17,418 --> 01:22:21,047
- You're a real caffeine junkie, aren't you?
- Keep it down. Just between us.

955
01:22:21,222 --> 01:22:22,621
Here, cheers.

956
01:22:30,264 --> 01:22:32,391
You know, before I gave that up...

957
01:22:32,600 --> 01:22:35,694
I used to drink it every single night...

958
01:22:35,870 --> 01:22:39,738
up until it was time to go to sleep.
Used to make me dream faster.

959
01:22:39,907 --> 01:22:43,434
You know, like when they flash
those cameras on those Indy 500 cars...

960
01:22:43,611 --> 01:22:45,238
and they just...

961
01:22:48,950 --> 01:22:51,578
That's how my dreams were.
Just whizzing by.

962
01:22:51,886 --> 01:22:54,753
- You're stupid, yo.
- He is stupid, isn't he?

963
01:22:54,956 --> 01:22:56,253
Word, yo.

964
01:23:00,328 --> 01:23:02,728
I know a guy who freezes coffee.

965
01:23:03,498 --> 01:23:06,433
Puts sticks in it,
has himself a coffee Popsicle.

966
01:23:06,601 --> 01:23:08,660
A caf pop.

967
01:23:13,641 --> 01:23:16,769
Damn. That don't sound too good,
Bill Murray.

968
01:23:16,944 --> 01:23:20,345
It's not the flu or anything.
It's just a smoker's cough.

969
01:23:22,583 --> 01:23:26,815
That's what I'm saying, nicotine interferes
with your central nervous system...

970
01:23:26,988 --> 01:23:28,785
your respiratorial system.

971
01:23:28,990 --> 01:23:32,448
In very small doses, it causes paralysis.

972
01:23:36,764 --> 01:23:39,130
- Really?
- Yeah, really, man.

973
01:23:39,333 --> 01:23:41,699
I mean, just 50mg alone...

974
01:23:42,303 --> 01:23:44,669
have been proven to be fatal
in a few minutes.

975
01:23:44,839 --> 01:23:47,467
- How much is in one cigarette?
- 3mg.

976
01:23:47,975 --> 01:23:50,967
And did you know
they also use nicotine for insecticide...

977
01:23:51,145 --> 01:23:54,205
- to kill bugs?
- It's good if it kills bugs, right?

978
01:23:55,716 --> 01:23:57,809
Are you a bug, Bill Murray?

979
01:23:59,854 --> 01:24:03,017
- Jesus, RZA, you sound like my doctor.
- He is a doctor.

980
01:24:03,457 --> 01:24:06,858
Actually, he specializes
in alternative medicine.

981
01:24:07,395 --> 01:24:09,955
That is, alternative to this planet.

982
01:24:14,202 --> 01:24:18,502
Do me a favor and don't tell anybody
you saw me here, okay?

983
01:24:19,240 --> 01:24:21,299
You can trust us, Bill Murray.

984
01:24:24,145 --> 01:24:28,172
- You hiding out or something?
- Yeah, sort of, something like that.

985
01:24:30,051 --> 01:24:31,985
Now I'm thinking it may be delirium.

986
01:24:32,153 --> 01:24:34,178
- Serious delirium.
- Serious.

987
01:24:35,223 --> 01:24:39,216
If you're on the low, I got something
that'll help you with your disguise.

988
01:24:39,860 --> 01:24:41,350
Take this.

989
01:24:42,096 --> 01:24:43,859
- Use whatever you want.
- Jeez.

990
01:24:44,065 --> 01:24:47,865
- Rock that, man. Stay on the low.
- You didn't have to do this. This is great.

991
01:24:48,035 --> 01:24:49,593
A bag of items for you, Bill.

992
01:24:49,604 --> 01:24:51,367
- Thank you.
- Don't worry about it.

993
01:24:51,572 --> 01:24:53,233
I really appreciate this.

994
01:24:55,343 --> 01:24:56,537
This is great.

995
01:24:58,746 --> 01:25:00,714
Doc, what could I do for this cough?

996
01:25:00,915 --> 01:25:03,440
I was just thinking about that.
Check this out.

997
01:25:03,618 --> 01:25:07,554
- You get some hydrogen peroxide.
- We got that for cuts and stuff.

998
01:25:07,722 --> 01:25:11,055
Take 50% hydrogen peroxide, 50% water.

999
01:25:11,259 --> 01:25:13,887
You gargle with it.
Do not swallow, you spit it out.

1000
01:25:14,061 --> 01:25:15,392
Don't swallow, Bill Murray.

1001
01:25:15,596 --> 01:25:18,565
And if that doesn't work, try oven cleaner.

1002
01:25:19,767 --> 01:25:21,894
I got that in the back, too.

1003
01:25:22,270 --> 01:25:23,965
- Thank you.
- Cool.

1004
01:25:24,205 --> 01:25:26,901
Thank you. I'm going to try it right now.

1005
01:25:29,610 --> 01:25:31,077
- Word.
- Word, man.

1006
01:25:31,279 --> 01:25:34,043
- Bill motherfucking Murray.
- It's crazy, yo.

1007
01:25:36,817 --> 01:25:38,546
- 3:00.
- What's up?

1008
01:25:38,753 --> 01:25:41,278
I told Ghost to be here by 3:00 a.m.

1009
01:25:41,455 --> 01:25:44,822
Don't hold your breath on that.
You know how it is waiting on Ghost.

1010
01:25:44,825 --> 01:25:47,760
- We'll be here all night.
- Think we can smoke a blunt up here?

1011
01:25:47,962 --> 01:25:51,728
- It's hot up in here with the 5-0.
- But we used to always smoke weed in here.

1012
01:25:51,899 --> 01:25:54,595
That was until Dirt Dog done blew it up.

1013
01:25:54,802 --> 01:25:57,771
Told Deflon,
"Never let Dirty inside this spot, man".

1014
01:25:57,938 --> 01:25:59,838
So what's up? What you want to do?

1015
01:25:59,840 --> 01:26:02,240
- Yo, let's slide to the 'udio.
- Hit the 'udio, right.

1016
01:26:02,410 --> 01:26:04,401
Play some chess? All right, then.

1017
01:26:04,578 --> 01:26:08,241
- Is that the bill for Murray?
- He don't need no money, yo.

1018
01:26:08,416 --> 01:26:11,146
- Hit him, anyway.
- Think I should tip him?

1019
01:26:14,989 --> 01:26:19,323
- You think he's using the oven cleaner?
- Don't know, but let's get the fuck out.

1020
01:26:44,952 --> 01:26:46,852
Are you all right, Taylor?

1021
01:26:49,690 --> 01:26:52,557
- No, not really.
- What's up?

1022
01:26:54,862 --> 01:26:58,730
I don't know.
I feel so divorced from the world.

1023
01:26:59,700 --> 01:27:01,895
I've lost touch with the world.

1024
01:27:03,371 --> 01:27:06,238
Do you know that song by Mahler...

1025
01:27:07,808 --> 01:27:11,335
- I've Lost Track of the World?
- No.

1026
01:27:13,013 --> 01:27:15,982
It's one of the most beautiful...

1027
01:27:16,150 --> 01:27:18,516
and saddest songs ever written.

1028
01:27:22,823 --> 01:27:24,757
I can almost hear it now.

1029
01:27:30,431 --> 01:27:32,023
Can you hear it?

1030
01:28:24,618 --> 01:28:26,051
It's gone now.

1031
01:28:26,787 --> 01:28:29,722
- But did you hear it?
- I think so.

1032
01:28:33,494 --> 01:28:36,725
It resonated
right through the whole building.

1033
01:28:38,899 --> 01:28:41,663
- Where are we?
- In the armory, Taylor.

1034
01:28:43,571 --> 01:28:45,562
The armory, Taylor.

1035
01:28:48,175 --> 01:28:51,633
It sounds so heavy and ponderous.

1036
01:28:53,180 --> 01:28:54,772
The armory.

1037
01:28:56,317 --> 01:28:59,115
Nikola Tesla...

1038
01:29:00,654 --> 01:29:04,090
perceived the Earth as a conductor...

1039
01:29:04,825 --> 01:29:08,124
of acoustical resonance.

1040
01:29:11,765 --> 01:29:14,529
I have no idea what you're talking about.

1041
01:29:16,871 --> 01:29:18,839
Can you explain it to me?

1042
01:29:19,106 --> 01:29:21,700
- No, not really.
- I know.

1043
01:29:22,877 --> 01:29:25,277
Let's pretend this coffee is champagne.

1044
01:29:27,281 --> 01:29:29,044
Why would we do that?

1045
01:29:29,817 --> 01:29:31,842
Well, to celebrate life.

1046
01:29:33,487 --> 01:29:36,684
You know, like the rich, elegant people do.

1047
01:29:37,825 --> 01:29:39,554
The classy people.

1048
01:29:41,061 --> 01:29:45,054
I prefer coffee.
Simple, working man's coffee.

1049
01:29:47,868 --> 01:29:51,998
You're so provincial, Bill.
Do you know what your problem is?

1050
01:29:53,574 --> 01:29:54,666
What?

1051
01:29:56,544 --> 01:30:00,241
You have no joie de vivre.

1052
01:30:02,550 --> 01:30:03,710
I don't?

1053
01:30:05,486 --> 01:30:09,013
No, besides, this coffee is awful.

1054
01:30:11,725 --> 01:30:15,217
- You're right. It really is bad, isn't it?
- Dreadful.

1055
01:30:16,564 --> 01:30:18,555
I propose a toast.

1056
01:30:20,000 --> 01:30:21,900
So what should we toast?

1057
01:30:25,172 --> 01:30:28,369
Paris in the 1920s.

1058
01:30:28,742 --> 01:30:31,575
Josephine Baker, the Moulin Rouge.

1059
01:30:32,246 --> 01:30:34,373
What is it? Okay?

1060
01:30:36,016 --> 01:30:37,347
And also...

1061
01:30:38,185 --> 01:30:40,710
New York in the '70s.

1062
01:30:41,055 --> 01:30:43,046
In the late '70s.

1063
01:30:43,924 --> 01:30:45,789
Really? All right.

1064
01:30:46,527 --> 01:30:48,290
Cheers.

1065
01:30:53,901 --> 01:30:55,562
Delicious, isn't it?

1066
01:30:57,705 --> 01:31:01,197
Champagne, nectar of the gods.

1067
01:31:02,910 --> 01:31:06,073
Is that all you're having for lunch,
coffee and a cigarette?

1068
01:31:06,280 --> 01:31:08,043
It's not very healthy.

1069
01:31:09,783 --> 01:31:11,580
We had lunch earlier.

1070
01:31:15,055 --> 01:31:16,249
We did?

1071
01:31:17,891 --> 01:31:21,987
We're on a break here, a coffee break.

1072
01:31:23,664 --> 01:31:25,427
How depressing.

1073
01:31:26,834 --> 01:31:28,927
How long is our break, anyway?

1074
01:31:29,103 --> 01:31:32,402
About 10 minutes, and it's nearly over now.

1075
01:31:36,610 --> 01:31:38,305
Say it isn't true.

1076
01:31:41,081 --> 01:31:43,072
- Well?
- What?

1077
01:31:44,284 --> 01:31:47,014
I asked you to say it isn't true.

1078
01:31:47,655 --> 01:31:49,350
