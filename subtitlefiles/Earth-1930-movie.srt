3
00:02:57,139 --> 00:02:59,209
Are you dying, Semion?

4
00:03:02,659 --> 00:03:04,776
Yes, I'm dying, Petro.

5
00:03:56,539 --> 00:03:58,531
Well, die then.

6
00:04:36,220 --> 00:04:41,169
Die, Semion. And after your
death let me know,

7
00:04:41,459 --> 00:04:46,738
where you are: in Paradise
or in Hell...

8
00:04:54,500 --> 00:04:56,694
...and how you're doing.

9
00:05:05,819 --> 00:05:11,372
Fine, Petro. If possible,
I'll give you notice.

10
00:05:38,420 --> 00:05:44,336
For 75 years he has plowed
the soil with oxen...

11
00:05:47,939 --> 00:05:49,771
That's no small achievement!

12
00:06:04,259 --> 00:06:09,014
If I were a People's Commissar,...

13
00:06:13,300 --> 00:06:18,249
...I'd given him the Order of
the Banner of Labor.

14
00:06:23,339 --> 00:06:28,174
There are no Orders for oxen,
grandfather.

15
00:06:30,300 --> 00:06:32,336
For what then?

16
00:07:17,899 --> 00:07:21,448
I could eat something.

17
00:09:17,259 --> 00:09:18,739
Live well, I'm dying.

18
00:10:21,820 --> 00:10:23,855
Pears he has liked.

19
00:12:15,220 --> 00:12:18,610
Go ahead, read on, friend!

20
00:12:26,100 --> 00:12:30,855
<i>"...The kulak Belokon
sabotages our work,</i>

21
00:12:31,139 --> 00:12:36,817
hides the seeds and
kills the livestock..."

22
00:13:14,299 --> 00:13:18,087
I’m not giving it away!
I'd rather kill it...!

23
00:13:37,460 --> 00:13:41,009
Now, father, the kulaks are
finished.

24
00:13:41,299 --> 00:13:45,008
We're getting machines as well.

25
00:13:58,779 --> 00:14:04,696
Vasili, I think, you're
not right in the head...

26
00:14:17,179 --> 00:14:22,936
When we have the machines,
we'll take their land away.

27
00:14:34,460 --> 00:14:38,578
I'm saying, you're crazy...

28
00:14:47,899 --> 00:14:53,531
It will work without you.
You don't have to go.

29
00:15:06,019 --> 00:15:09,250
The whole village is laughing already.

30
00:15:15,580 --> 00:15:18,538
It's not the whole village that's
laughing, father,

31
00:15:18,820 --> 00:15:21,778
just the kulaks and the stupid.

32
00:15:24,220 --> 00:15:28,293
You're saying I'm stupid?

33
00:15:39,179 --> 00:15:43,969
Not stupid, father,
you just have grown old.

34
00:15:59,340 --> 00:16:02,776
<i>Oh, the village Komsomol
is coming!</i>

35
00:16:16,860 --> 00:16:20,330
Then open the meeting!

36
00:18:33,700 --> 00:18:38,979
These filthy dogs,
splendid fellows!

37
00:19:49,980 --> 00:19:51,777
Father! I’m going!

38
00:21:02,220 --> 00:21:05,529
Semion, where are you now?

39
00:21:19,900 --> 00:21:22,288
Greetings, grandfather Petro!

40
00:21:30,619 --> 00:21:33,008
Grandfather Petro, greetings!

41
00:21:37,700 --> 00:21:41,898
Get lost,
devil's brood!

42
00:23:33,160 --> 00:23:33,660
It's moving!

43
00:23:35,859 --> 00:23:36,559
It's moving!

44
00:23:37,779 --> 00:23:38,180
It's moving!

45
00:25:07,240 --> 00:25:07,940
It has stopped!

46
00:25:09,619 --> 00:25:10,219
It has stopped!

47
00:25:11,819 --> 00:25:12,119
It's moving!

48
00:25:14,940 --> 00:25:15,440
It has stopped!

49
00:25:18,299 --> 00:25:18,700
It has stopped!

50
00:25:26,900 --> 00:25:29,619
Write: premises are lacking

51
00:25:29,900 --> 00:25:32,538
for collective seeds and
livestock,

52
00:25:32,859 --> 00:25:38,775
but not wonderful buildings
for the kulaks...

53
00:25:44,160 --> 00:25:44,660
It's moving!

54
00:25:46,460 --> 00:25:46,960
It has stopped!

55
00:25:50,319 --> 00:25:50,819
It has stopped!

56
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:13,380
I hear!

57
00:26:34,559 --> 00:26:35,059
I hear!

58
00:26:42,740 --> 00:26:43,339
I hear!

59
00:26:58,500 --> 00:27:02,378
No water in the cooler.

60
00:27:10,220 --> 00:27:11,971
I hear!

61
00:27:38,660 --> 00:27:41,333
Comrade chairman!

62
00:27:41,619 --> 00:27:46,818
In the city they want to know,
if the tractor has arrived.

63
00:27:57,099 --> 00:28:01,456
Comrade chairman,
the tractor is standing still!

64
00:28:11,900 --> 00:28:17,850
The tractor has arrived,
the whole village witnessed it.

65
00:29:05,940 --> 00:29:10,218
The tractor can't be standing
still.

66
00:29:37,319 --> 00:29:38,220
Go!

67
00:29:40,180 --> 00:29:40,680
Go on then!

68
00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:46,240
Go!

69
00:31:49,660 --> 00:31:50,759
It has been accomplished!

70
00:32:00,099 --> 00:32:03,375
The have brought it.
That's the end.

71
00:32:17,500 --> 00:32:23,336
Grandfather Petro is right:
It has been accomplished!

72
00:32:25,980 --> 00:32:28,210
May we

73
00:32:28,539 --> 00:32:31,008
prosper

74
00:32:31,339 --> 00:32:33,534
with the machines!

75
00:32:40,140 --> 00:32:45,658
Now the kulaks can just mourn
their field borders!

76
00:32:55,059 --> 00:33:00,373
Beware, so your mother has nothing
to mourn about!

77
00:33:33,059 --> 00:33:35,050
We will see.

78
00:33:40,779 --> 00:33:42,770
We will see.

79
00:34:06,259 --> 00:34:08,454
It's happening, Choma!

80
00:35:16,019 --> 00:35:18,010
Father!

81
00:35:24,139 --> 00:35:26,016
Throw away these crutches!

82
00:41:10,539 --> 00:41:13,976
Throw me up!
I'll pay for it!

83
00:41:27,900 --> 00:41:33,452
Choma! Vasili has plowed the
field with the tractor!

84
00:49:31,619 --> 00:49:33,610
Vasili!

85
00:50:17,099 --> 00:50:19,489
Hey, Iwans!

86
00:50:22,059 --> 00:50:23,413
Hey, Stepans!

87
00:50:29,019 --> 00:50:30,338
Hey, Grizkas!

88
00:50:34,659 --> 00:50:37,413
Have you killed my Vasili?

89
00:51:37,820 --> 00:51:39,617
Choma, you?

90
00:51:52,219 --> 00:51:58,215
I'm asking you:
Have you killed Vasili?

91
00:52:08,500 --> 00:52:11,536
No, uncle, it wasn't me.

92
00:55:53,619 --> 00:55:55,576
There is no God.

93
00:56:22,260 --> 00:56:24,251
And there are no priests either.

94
00:57:44,179 --> 00:57:46,375
I’m asking you...

95
00:58:10,099 --> 00:58:13,808
Just like Vasili died for
the new life,

96
00:58:14,099 --> 00:58:19,492
I'm asking you, to bury him
according to the new ways...

97
00:58:31,739 --> 00:58:37,371
Neither priests nor church servants
beyond the grave...

98
00:58:44,619 --> 00:58:49,647
It have to be our boys
and girls themselves...

99
00:58:57,500 --> 00:59:03,018
And they are to sing new songs
about the new life!

100
00:59:24,539 --> 00:59:30,217
Good, Uncle Opanas, we'll bury
our Vasili ourselves.

101
00:59:42,500 --> 00:59:46,128
Without priests or church servants.

102
00:59:58,900 --> 01:00:04,610
And we'll sing new songs
about the new life!

103
01:01:25,219 --> 01:01:29,690
Without a priest! Good,
if there's no God...

104
01:01:34,500 --> 01:01:36,331
And if He exists after all?

105
01:04:26,059 --> 01:04:29,893
God, punish the sinners!

106
01:04:44,019 --> 01:04:46,614
Punish them, God!

107
01:05:59,460 --> 01:06:02,896
It's my Earth!
I won't give it up!

108
01:06:19,739 --> 01:06:20,854
Punish them!

109
01:06:42,940 --> 01:06:44,931
Where is the priest?

110
01:06:52,340 --> 01:06:57,778
<i>He's in there.
Damn the kolkhozy.</i>

111
01:07:10,300 --> 01:07:11,200
Vasili!

112
01:07:52,420 --> 01:07:53,320
Vasili!

113
01:09:50,100 --> 01:09:54,012
The deadly hate of the enemy
on poverty

114
01:09:54,300 --> 01:09:58,087
took Vasili away from you...

115
01:10:20,420 --> 01:10:22,520
Hey, you have-nots!
It's me!

116
01:10:40,260 --> 01:10:45,208
Beat me up! I'd rather die,
than give myself up!

117
01:10:48,260 --> 01:10:52,219
With the iron horse
of Bolshevism

118
01:10:52,500 --> 01:10:57,528
Vasili destroyed thousand year old fields!

119
01:11:03,020 --> 01:11:05,773
I’ve killed him at night!

120
01:11:23,420 --> 01:11:27,538
At night, when everyone was sleeping!

121
01:11:36,659 --> 01:11:39,856
And he walked on the street...

122
01:11:42,180 --> 01:11:43,851
And danced!

123
01:11:56,539 --> 01:11:59,337
...with his hot blood

124
01:11:59,619 --> 01:12:03,976
he wrote the class enemy
the death sentence...

125
01:12:15,420 --> 01:12:19,731
And you, Uncle Opanas,
mustn’t grieve.

126
01:12:33,180 --> 01:12:38,731
Vasili's fame will fly around
the entire world...

127
01:12:43,699 --> 01:12:46,657
...like our Bolshevist airplane above!

128
01:16:57,340 --> 01:17:00,297
THE END

129
