1
00:02:11,547 --> 00:02:13,633
Hilario.

2
00:02:46,791 --> 00:02:48,876
Papa!

3
00:03:26,831 --> 00:03:29,000
Sotero! My good friend.

4
00:03:29,208 --> 00:03:31,502
How are ya?

5
00:03:38,926 --> 00:03:41,095
You have a drink?

6
00:03:43,306 --> 00:03:46,851
I can't tell you what a pleasure
it is to see a village like this.

7
00:03:53,733 --> 00:03:55,902
Santos!

8
00:03:56,027 --> 00:03:58,946
So much restlessness
and change in the outside world.

9
00:03:59,030 --> 00:04:02,158
People no longer content
with their station in life.

10
00:04:02,283 --> 00:04:05,077
Women's fashions? Shameless.

11
00:04:05,828 --> 00:04:07,788
Cigar.

12
00:04:07,997 --> 00:04:09,874
<i>¡Mire!</i>
Religion!

13
00:04:10,082 --> 00:04:14,170
You'd weep if you saw how true religion
is now a thing of the past.

14
00:04:15,713 --> 00:04:20,092
Last month we were in San Juan -
a rich town. Sit down.

15
00:04:21,552 --> 00:04:24,180
Rich town, much blessed by God.

16
00:04:24,263 --> 00:04:26,766
Big church.

17
00:04:26,891 --> 00:04:31,896
Not like here - little church,
priest comes twice a year. Big one!

18
00:04:31,979 --> 00:04:35,858
You think we find gold candlesticks,
poor box filled to overflowing?

19
00:04:36,067 --> 00:04:37,944
You know what we found?

20
00:04:38,027 --> 00:04:41,364
Brass candlesticks,
almost nothing in the poor box.

21
00:04:41,697 --> 00:04:44,283
But we took it anyway.

22
00:04:44,492 --> 00:04:47,537
I know we took it anyway.

23
00:04:47,745 --> 00:04:51,707
I'm trying to show him how little religion
some people now have.

24
00:04:51,916 --> 00:04:54,210
That I could see for myself.

25
00:04:56,796 --> 00:04:58,798
Don't see!

26
00:04:59,841 --> 00:05:02,009
What if you had to carry my load, huh?

27
00:05:02,218 --> 00:05:06,389
The need to provide food, like a father,
to fill the mouths of his hungry men.

28
00:05:06,514 --> 00:05:08,474
Guns. Ammunition.

29
00:05:09,934 --> 00:05:13,688
You know how much money
that costs? Huh? Huh?

30
00:05:13,896 --> 00:05:15,481
No.

31
00:05:15,565 --> 00:05:17,775
The days of good hunting are over.

32
00:05:17,984 --> 00:05:22,864
Once there was horses, cattle,
gold, fruit from the trees. No more.

33
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:28,911
Now I must hunt with a price
on my head, rurales at my heels.

34
00:05:34,125 --> 00:05:36,127
I'll be back.

35
00:05:38,421 --> 00:05:40,506
Enough!

36
00:05:48,514 --> 00:05:51,225
We'll get the rest when we come back.

37
00:05:57,190 --> 00:05:59,483
I love this village.

38
00:06:00,610 --> 00:06:04,780
- I know you have your problems...
- Murderer! Thief!

39
00:06:06,782 --> 00:06:08,743
<i>(gunshots)</i>

40
00:06:11,787 --> 00:06:13,748
Rafael!

41
00:06:14,290 --> 00:06:15,833
Rafael!

42
00:06:15,958 --> 00:06:17,210
Rafael...

43
00:06:17,418 --> 00:06:19,587
<i>(sobs)</i> Rafael!

44
00:06:20,963 --> 00:06:22,924
Stupid!

45
00:06:24,509 --> 00:06:26,594
Stupid!

46
00:06:28,471 --> 00:06:31,474
We have to have
another discussion very soon.

47
00:06:31,682 --> 00:06:35,853
It's always a pleasure to hear
the views of my good friend Sotero.

48
00:06:38,147 --> 00:06:40,858
Maybe when I come back, hm?

49
00:06:40,983 --> 00:06:42,109
¡Adiós!

50
00:06:42,235 --> 00:06:44,195
Let's go!

51
00:07:16,227 --> 00:07:18,187
Help me bring him in.

52
00:07:40,710 --> 00:07:42,920
If he steals our harvest again,...

53
00:07:43,004 --> 00:07:46,549
..we might as well
cut our throats and be done with it!

54
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:50,303
Leave the valley. That's what we must do.

55
00:07:50,428 --> 00:07:55,641
- Live somewhere else?
- Take our homes with us? Our farms?

56
00:07:55,850 --> 00:07:58,352
We... could hide some food.

57
00:07:59,395 --> 00:08:03,441
From Calvera?
He never steals all our food.

58
00:08:03,649 --> 00:08:08,154
- He leaves us enough to go on with.
- That's something.

59
00:08:08,362 --> 00:08:10,323
We could beg him to leave us more.

60
00:08:10,448 --> 00:08:14,827
No, no. That would make him more angry.
I don't think we should do anything.

61
00:08:15,036 --> 00:08:17,747
We must do something!

62
00:08:17,955 --> 00:08:20,541
Like Rafael? Talk sense.

63
00:08:20,750 --> 00:08:24,295
We break our backs in the fields,
and our bellies stay empty.

64
00:08:24,504 --> 00:08:28,257
- We must do something!
- We must do something.

65
00:08:28,591 --> 00:08:30,551
But what?

66
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:32,762
I don't know.

67
00:08:39,101 --> 00:08:41,521
We'll ask the old man.

68
00:08:42,647 --> 00:08:44,857
He'll know.

69
00:08:46,192 --> 00:08:48,069
Fight.

70
00:08:48,194 --> 00:08:50,780
You must fight. Fight!

71
00:08:51,405 --> 00:08:55,076
With machetes and bare hands
against guns?

72
00:08:55,159 --> 00:08:57,662
- Buy guns.
- Buy?

73
00:08:57,787 --> 00:09:01,749
Go to the border. Guns are plentiful there.

74
00:09:01,832 --> 00:09:04,961
But what are we going to use for money?

75
00:09:16,764 --> 00:09:18,641
Sell that.

76
00:09:18,724 --> 00:09:21,435
And anything else you can collect.

77
00:09:23,646 --> 00:09:25,606
Even if we had the guns,...

78
00:09:25,815 --> 00:09:30,611
..we know how to plant and grow -
we don't know how to kill.

79
00:09:30,736 --> 00:09:33,114
Then learn.

80
00:09:33,239 --> 00:09:35,199
Or die.

81
00:10:31,839 --> 00:10:34,634
Hey! I've been waitin' for you.

82
00:10:35,885 --> 00:10:38,596
Oh, you did a wonderful job.

83
00:10:38,721 --> 00:10:41,933
- I'm sorry, but there'll be no funeral.
- What?

84
00:10:42,058 --> 00:10:46,437
The grave's dug, and the defunct is as
ready as the embalmer can make him,...

85
00:10:46,646 --> 00:10:50,066
- ..but there'll be no funeral.
- Didn't I pay you enough?

86
00:10:50,191 --> 00:10:54,987
It's not a question of money. For $20, I'd
plant anybody with a whoop and a holler.

87
00:10:55,196 --> 00:10:57,990
But the funeral's off.

88
00:10:58,115 --> 00:11:00,201
Well, how d'ya like that?

89
00:11:00,284 --> 00:11:04,789
I want him buried. You want him buried.
If he could talk, he'd second the motion.

90
00:11:04,872 --> 00:11:09,585
- That's as unanimous as you can get.
- You've behaved like a Christian, but...

91
00:11:09,669 --> 00:11:12,296
Now, look. I'm not lookin' for any praise.

92
00:11:12,505 --> 00:11:14,799
I'm a travelling salesman
- Ladies' corsets.

93
00:11:14,882 --> 00:11:17,510
I'm walking down the street
and a man drops dead.

94
00:11:17,718 --> 00:11:21,264
For two hours people stepped over him,
without lifting a finger.

95
00:11:21,472 --> 00:11:23,558
I'm doing what any decent man would.

96
00:11:23,641 --> 00:11:26,477
- Come on, Henry...
- No! This man has to be buried.

97
00:11:26,561 --> 00:11:30,731
- Soon. He's not turning into a nosegay.
- I know. I would if I could, but...

98
00:11:30,940 --> 00:11:35,528
- ..there's an element in town that objects.
- Objects? To what?

99
00:11:35,653 --> 00:11:39,907
- They say he isn't fit to be buried there.
- What? In Boot Hill?

100
00:11:40,032 --> 00:11:43,578
There's nothing there but murderers,
cutthroats and barflies.

101
00:11:43,786 --> 00:11:46,581
And if they ever felt exclusive,
they're past it now.

102
00:11:46,789 --> 00:11:49,417
They happen to be white, friend.

103
00:11:49,625 --> 00:11:51,586
And old Sam...

104
00:11:52,753 --> 00:11:55,256
Well, old Sam was an lndian.

105
00:11:56,299 --> 00:11:58,593
Well, I'll be damned!

106
00:11:58,676 --> 00:12:02,555
I never knew you had to be anything
but a corpse to get into Boot Hill.

107
00:12:02,638 --> 00:12:06,809
- How long's this been going on?
- Since the town got civilised.

108
00:12:06,934 --> 00:12:09,520
It's not my doin', boys.
I don't like it. No, sir.

109
00:12:09,645 --> 00:12:12,982
I've always treated every man
as another future customer.

110
00:12:13,065 --> 00:12:16,527
- In that case, get that hearse rollin'.
- My driver's quit.

111
00:12:16,611 --> 00:12:20,781
- He's prejudiced too, huh?
- If it comes to gettin' his head blown off.

112
00:12:20,907 --> 00:12:24,535
- Well, get somebody else.
- Nobody else will drive it! So here.

113
00:12:24,660 --> 00:12:28,915
Oh, hell! If that's all that's
holding things up, I'll drive the rig.

114
00:12:38,007 --> 00:12:40,593
Can I borrow that scatter-gun?

115
00:12:40,718 --> 00:12:43,012
You're more than welcome.

116
00:12:48,309 --> 00:12:53,856
Hey! Wait a minute there. This hearse cost
me $840. It's the only one in the county.

117
00:12:54,065 --> 00:12:57,902
- I'll be darned if I let it be shot at.
- I'll pay for the damages.

118
00:12:58,110 --> 00:13:01,155
- I wanna see this.
- Me, too!

119
00:13:04,075 --> 00:13:06,869
Never rode shotgun on a hearse before.

120
00:13:19,590 --> 00:13:22,218
Let her buck.

121
00:13:54,417 --> 00:13:56,711
- New in town?
- Yeah.

122
00:13:56,919 --> 00:14:00,256
- Where are you from?
- Dodge. You?

123
00:14:01,007 --> 00:14:05,052
- Tombstone. See any action up there?
- Uh-uh.

124
00:14:05,261 --> 00:14:09,223
- Tombstone?
- Same. People all settled down, like.

125
00:14:09,348 --> 00:14:11,851
- Same all over.
- (Man) Injun lovers!

126
00:14:11,934 --> 00:14:14,645
Easy. Just wind.

127
00:14:14,979 --> 00:14:19,233
- We'll get there.
- It's not gettin' up there that bothers me.

128
00:14:19,358 --> 00:14:21,861
It's stayin' up there that I mind.

129
00:14:27,491 --> 00:14:29,660
Comin' up behind us on the left.

130
00:14:32,705 --> 00:14:34,874
I don't think so.

131
00:14:40,213 --> 00:14:43,841
Second-storey window. Curtain moved.

132
00:14:43,966 --> 00:14:47,303
I'm not in a good position.
Let him stick his neck out.

133
00:14:50,723 --> 00:14:54,477
- You elected?
- No.

134
00:14:54,602 --> 00:14:57,104
I got nominated real good.

135
00:14:59,815 --> 00:15:04,195
Boys, why don't you just turn around
now - save yourselves a lot of trouble?

136
00:15:04,403 --> 00:15:07,198
Soon, huh?

137
00:15:09,825 --> 00:15:12,745
The reception committee is forming.

138
00:15:32,765 --> 00:15:34,100
Hold it.

139
00:15:34,225 --> 00:15:36,519
Hold it right there.

140
00:15:39,230 --> 00:15:41,315
Anything wrong?

141
00:15:47,029 --> 00:15:50,366
Turn that rig around
and get it down the hill.

142
00:16:05,923 --> 00:16:08,301
I need six men up here.

143
00:16:36,245 --> 00:16:37,705
Yahoo!

144
00:16:41,459 --> 00:16:44,587
- Boys, the drinks are on me!
<i>- (Cheering)</i>

145
00:17:18,996 --> 00:17:21,082
Hey! Hey!

146
00:17:21,207 --> 00:17:24,335
I'd like to buy you a drink.
And your friend, too.

147
00:17:27,463 --> 00:17:29,423
Thanks.

148
00:17:29,549 --> 00:17:31,717
Where are you from?

149
00:17:32,885 --> 00:17:35,263
Oh, yeah. Where are you goin'?

150
00:17:37,265 --> 00:17:40,810
- Thanks for the free show.
- You're more than welcome.

151
00:17:41,310 --> 00:17:45,398
Boy, that was really something. I won't
forget that if I live to be a hundred.

152
00:17:45,606 --> 00:17:48,401
- Henry, the stage is leavin'!
- All right, all right!

153
00:17:48,609 --> 00:17:53,114
Wait till Flora hears about this.
Y'know, she won't believe one word of it.

154
00:17:53,197 --> 00:17:55,491
Henry! The stage! Come on!

155
00:17:57,577 --> 00:17:59,787
You keep this.

156
00:18:26,063 --> 00:18:30,651
- Where are you headed?
- I'm drifting south, more or less.

157
00:18:30,860 --> 00:18:32,612
You?

158
00:18:32,737 --> 00:18:34,614
Just driftin'.

159
00:18:34,822 --> 00:18:36,157
- Any action here?
- Yeah.

160
00:18:36,282 --> 00:18:40,953
Grocery clerk and bouncer in one of those
bars across the street, if that's your taste.

161
00:18:41,162 --> 00:18:43,873
- Ah.
- Yeah.

162
00:18:43,998 --> 00:18:46,083
Well... see ya.

163
00:18:48,586 --> 00:18:50,963
Say, uh... what's your name?

164
00:18:52,548 --> 00:18:54,634
Make it Vin.

165
00:18:54,842 --> 00:18:57,345
- What's yours?
- Chris.

166
00:19:16,197 --> 00:19:18,199
<i>(knock at door)</i>

167
00:19:28,709 --> 00:19:29,669
Yes?

168
00:19:38,427 --> 00:19:41,138
We think you are a man we can trust.

169
00:19:42,890 --> 00:19:45,184
- Thank you very much.
- We wish you to help us.

170
00:19:45,393 --> 00:19:48,729
- There's this man, Calvera.
- A thief. A murderer.

171
00:19:48,855 --> 00:19:52,608
He and his men, they steal our food,
and then they leave us to starve.

172
00:19:52,817 --> 00:19:56,153
- Not only that, but our women...
- Wait, wait. Just a minute.

173
00:19:56,362 --> 00:20:00,324
- If you need protection, go to the rurales.
- We did. Twice.

174
00:20:00,616 --> 00:20:05,538
But they can't station men in a small
village for... who knows how long?

175
00:20:05,746 --> 00:20:06,873
So they left.

176
00:20:06,998 --> 00:20:11,043
And when they left, he came again -
Calvera - and every year since.

177
00:20:11,252 --> 00:20:14,088
He will do so until he is stopped.

178
00:20:15,756 --> 00:20:17,717
Sit down.

179
00:20:23,055 --> 00:20:27,226
- We need help.
- We must buy guns.

180
00:20:27,310 --> 00:20:30,229
We know nothing about them.

181
00:20:30,438 --> 00:20:32,732
Will you buy guns for us?

182
00:20:32,857 --> 00:20:35,985
Guns are very expensive and hard to get.

183
00:20:37,028 --> 00:20:39,739
- Why don't you hire men?
- Men?

184
00:20:39,822 --> 00:20:43,367
Gunmen.
Nowadays men are cheaper than guns.

185
00:20:43,576 --> 00:20:47,455
- Will you go?
- It will be a blessing if you help us.

186
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:52,043
- Sorry, I'm not in the blessing business.
- No, no. We offer more than that.

187
00:20:52,126 --> 00:20:55,046
- We could feed you every day.
- And we have this.

188
00:20:55,254 --> 00:20:57,256
What's that?

189
00:20:57,465 --> 00:21:00,468
We can sell this for gold.

190
00:21:00,593 --> 00:21:02,678
Everything we own.

191
00:21:02,762 --> 00:21:04,972
Everything of value in the village.

192
00:21:07,058 --> 00:21:11,729
I've been offered a lot for my work,
but never everything.

193
00:21:11,938 --> 00:21:14,023
Will it be enough?

194
00:21:14,148 --> 00:21:17,902
You see,
if we could drive the bandits away,...

195
00:21:18,110 --> 00:21:20,696
..life could be very good in our village.

196
00:21:20,905 --> 00:21:25,618
But as it is, we ourselves
could stand it a little longer,...

197
00:21:25,826 --> 00:21:29,163
..but the children,
they cry because they're hungry.

198
00:21:30,414 --> 00:21:34,043
Do you understand what it means
when you start something like this?

199
00:21:34,252 --> 00:21:36,462
We will fight, too. Every one of us.

200
00:21:36,671 --> 00:21:39,590
When Calvera comes,
the church bell will ring the alarm.

201
00:21:39,799 --> 00:21:42,301
We'll fight with guns, if we have them.

202
00:21:42,510 --> 00:21:46,264
If we don't, with machetes,
axes, clubs, anything!

203
00:21:50,935 --> 00:21:52,937
Once you begin,...

204
00:21:53,020 --> 00:21:56,148
..you have to be prepared
for killing and more killing.

205
00:21:56,274 --> 00:21:59,068
And still more killing -
until the reason for it has gone.

206
00:21:59,193 --> 00:22:02,196
- We understand.
- We've considered that.

207
00:22:02,321 --> 00:22:05,116
Does every man in the village
feel the same?

208
00:22:05,241 --> 00:22:07,326
Every man.

209
00:22:09,412 --> 00:22:12,331
- I'll see what I can do for you.
- Gracias. You know...

210
00:22:12,415 --> 00:22:14,709
Now, wait. I didn't say I'll go.

211
00:22:15,668 --> 00:22:18,462
I'll pass the word around
that you're looking for men.

212
00:22:18,588 --> 00:22:23,050
It won't be hard to find men here.
Everyone wears a gun.

213
00:22:23,801 --> 00:22:27,221
Sure - same as they wear pants.
That's expected.

214
00:22:27,346 --> 00:22:30,683
But good men?
That's something else again.

215
00:22:30,892 --> 00:22:33,269
How can you tell they are good?

216
00:22:35,146 --> 00:22:37,148
There are ways.

217
00:22:39,859 --> 00:22:41,819
<i>(knocking)</i>

218
00:22:46,949 --> 00:22:49,243
Come in.

219
00:22:52,371 --> 00:22:54,749
The word is out you're looking for men.

220
00:22:54,874 --> 00:22:57,585
That's right. Men who are good with that.

221
00:22:57,668 --> 00:23:00,796
- I'm good with it.
- Fast?

222
00:23:01,756 --> 00:23:04,759
- Try me.
- I aim to. Step in closer.

223
00:23:07,386 --> 00:23:10,097
Now, hold your hands like that.

224
00:23:11,140 --> 00:23:13,100
Now, clap.

225
00:23:13,309 --> 00:23:14,894
Faster.

226
00:23:15,102 --> 00:23:17,271
Now, as fast as you can.

227
00:23:26,989 --> 00:23:29,158
Now you try it.

228
00:24:02,733 --> 00:24:05,444
Very young and... and very proud.

229
00:24:06,821 --> 00:24:11,701
The graveyards are full of boys
who were very young and very proud.

230
00:24:12,660 --> 00:24:14,620
<i>(knocking)</i>

231
00:24:22,044 --> 00:24:24,130
Come in.

232
00:24:43,941 --> 00:24:48,196
- No tricks now, Chris.
- Harry! It's good to see you again.

233
00:24:48,321 --> 00:24:50,698
- Chris.
- What are you doing in this dump?

234
00:24:50,907 --> 00:24:54,368
- I heard you've got a contract open.
- Not for a high-stepper like you.

235
00:24:54,577 --> 00:24:57,580
A dollar bill always looks
as big to me as a bedspread.

236
00:24:57,788 --> 00:24:59,248
It's just eating money.

237
00:24:59,457 --> 00:25:03,836
A gold eagle, room and board.
Six weeks gunning for some farmers.

238
00:25:03,961 --> 00:25:08,341
You old Cajun! You don't talk so good,
but you always know what's goin' on.

239
00:25:08,549 --> 00:25:10,510
Oh, Harry.

240
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:15,014
With your permission.

241
00:25:16,057 --> 00:25:19,810
All right. All that's on top.
What's underneath?

242
00:25:20,019 --> 00:25:23,856
- Only what I told you.
- Gold? Cattle? Payroll?

243
00:25:23,981 --> 00:25:27,944
- Only what I told you.
- Sure, never mind. Tell me when you can.

244
00:25:28,236 --> 00:25:31,155
Harry, please don't understand me so fast!

245
00:25:31,280 --> 00:25:33,866
I said never mind. I'm in.

246
00:25:33,991 --> 00:25:36,077
You dirty dog!

247
00:25:55,888 --> 00:25:57,974
Place your bets.

248
00:26:05,773 --> 00:26:07,775
Five.

249
00:26:10,987 --> 00:26:12,989
Five.

250
00:26:17,159 --> 00:26:19,453
Eight.

251
00:26:23,291 --> 00:26:25,585
Eights again. Ten at the point.

252
00:26:30,089 --> 00:26:33,301
The cowpoke that just walked in
in the stovepipe chaps,...

253
00:26:33,426 --> 00:26:36,637
- ..I'd like to buy him a drink.
- Yes, sir!

254
00:26:36,846 --> 00:26:40,725
Válgame Dios. There's one.
Look at the scars on his face.

255
00:26:40,808 --> 00:26:43,936
The man for us
is the one who gave him that face.

256
00:26:44,145 --> 00:26:46,564
Hey... you learn fast.

257
00:26:48,024 --> 00:26:50,193
Next bet comin' up.

258
00:26:59,702 --> 00:27:01,662
Crap.

259
00:27:06,792 --> 00:27:08,961
Next man.

260
00:27:11,797 --> 00:27:14,592
Gent over there wants to buy you a drink.

261
00:27:22,433 --> 00:27:24,602
- Vin.
- Howdy.

262
00:27:24,727 --> 00:27:28,481
- I'd like to buy you a drink.
- Whisky.

263
00:27:28,564 --> 00:27:30,858
Have you anything lined up?

264
00:27:31,067 --> 00:27:34,820
Yeah. I'm gonna take a job
in a grocery store.

265
00:27:34,946 --> 00:27:38,783
Fella says I'm gonna
make a crackerjack clerk.

266
00:27:38,908 --> 00:27:40,660
Crackerjack.

267
00:27:40,868 --> 00:27:43,079
If that's your taste...

268
00:27:44,747 --> 00:27:48,793
I heard of a job shooin' some flies away
from a village, but I don't know the pay.

269
00:27:48,918 --> 00:27:50,878
$20.

270
00:27:51,003 --> 00:27:53,798
- A week?
- Six weeks: the whole job.

271
00:27:54,006 --> 00:27:56,217
Well, that's ridiculous.

272
00:27:59,220 --> 00:28:01,931
- You heard of anything?
- Yeah.

273
00:28:02,139 --> 00:28:05,476
Shooing some flies away
from a little village.

274
00:28:05,810 --> 00:28:07,979
Their village.

275
00:28:09,564 --> 00:28:11,524
It pays $20?

276
00:28:12,567 --> 00:28:15,069
I'm looking for men right now.

277
00:28:16,654 --> 00:28:20,408
- No, it wouldn't even pay for my bullets.
- Ours is a poor village.

278
00:28:20,491 --> 00:28:23,744
We understand. You could get
much more in a grocery store,...

279
00:28:23,828 --> 00:28:25,913
..and it's good, steady work.

280
00:28:26,664 --> 00:28:28,624
Yep.

281
00:28:30,501 --> 00:28:32,795
How many you got?

282
00:29:00,948 --> 00:29:02,825
Looking for O'Reilly.

283
00:29:02,950 --> 00:29:08,247
Don't know his name, but there's a fella
in back choppin' wood for his breakfast.

284
00:29:24,639 --> 00:29:26,599
Mornin'.

285
00:29:29,018 --> 00:29:31,187
I'm a friend of Harry Luck's.

286
00:29:31,312 --> 00:29:33,272
He tells me you're broke.

287
00:29:33,481 --> 00:29:37,026
Nah, I'm doing this because
I'm an eccentric millionaire(!)

288
00:29:37,151 --> 00:29:42,156
There's a job for six men, watching over
a village, south of the border.

289
00:29:42,990 --> 00:29:45,576
How big's the opposition?

290
00:29:45,701 --> 00:29:47,870
Thirty guns.

291
00:29:51,332 --> 00:29:54,877
I admire your notion of fair odds, mister.

292
00:29:54,961 --> 00:29:58,422
Harry tells me you faced bigger odds
in the Travis County war.

293
00:29:58,506 --> 00:30:02,260
Well, they paid me $600 for that one.

294
00:30:02,385 --> 00:30:04,971
He said you got that Salinas thing
cleared up.

295
00:30:05,096 --> 00:30:07,890
They paid me $800 for that one.

296
00:30:08,015 --> 00:30:11,561
- You cost a lot.
- Yeah...

297
00:30:11,644 --> 00:30:14,146
That's right, I cost a lot.

298
00:30:14,897 --> 00:30:17,483
The offer is $20.

299
00:30:32,081 --> 00:30:34,166
$20?

300
00:30:38,754 --> 00:30:41,257
Right now, that's a lot.

301
00:30:41,465 --> 00:30:44,802
- Where can I reach you?
- Right here.

302
00:30:50,850 --> 00:30:53,477
- I still say he can't.
- And I tell you he can.

303
00:30:53,686 --> 00:30:57,106
- If he claims that, he's a liar.
- Not so loud. He might hear you.

304
00:30:57,231 --> 00:30:59,942
I don't give a damn if he hears me or not.

305
00:31:00,151 --> 00:31:03,070
I got two months' salary comin'.
I'll bet it all it ain't so.

306
00:31:03,279 --> 00:31:05,781
- Well, you ain't bettin' with me.
- Me either.

307
00:31:05,865 --> 00:31:07,950
I told you what he said, and I believe him.

308
00:31:08,075 --> 00:31:11,412
- Well, one of us is a fathead.
- You can get good odds on which.

309
00:31:11,621 --> 00:31:13,998
Ha! Ha! Ha!

310
00:31:21,422 --> 00:31:23,591
Britt. Britt, wake up.

311
00:31:25,468 --> 00:31:27,970
I'm talkin' to ya! Look at me!

312
00:31:31,432 --> 00:31:36,229
Filene told me what you said.
I say you're wrong. What d'you say?

313
00:31:39,357 --> 00:31:41,317
Ha! Ha! Ha!

314
00:31:43,611 --> 00:31:47,782
What's the matter? You afraid?
Afraid to tell me I'm wrong?

315
00:32:26,696 --> 00:32:28,865
Call it.

316
00:32:39,709 --> 00:32:41,794
Well, you see, I won.

317
00:32:42,003 --> 00:32:44,088
Well, how about it?

318
00:32:47,842 --> 00:32:49,844
Well?

319
00:32:52,972 --> 00:32:55,892
- Filene, how about it?
- I don't know. It was mighty close.

320
00:32:56,100 --> 00:33:00,897
Close? What d'you mean, close? You all
got eyes. You saw what happened. I won!

321
00:33:07,445 --> 00:33:09,530
You tell 'em. I won, didn't l?

322
00:33:09,655 --> 00:33:11,741
You lost.

323
00:33:29,258 --> 00:33:31,427
You're a liar.

324
00:33:33,930 --> 00:33:36,224
I said you're a liar!

325
00:33:37,892 --> 00:33:40,186
I said you're a coward and a liar!

326
00:33:44,065 --> 00:33:47,068
Get up. Let's do it for real.

327
00:33:48,236 --> 00:33:49,779
Get up!

328
00:33:49,904 --> 00:33:52,490
Get up, I said!

329
00:33:52,615 --> 00:33:56,452
So help me, I'll let you have it
right where you are.

330
00:34:08,756 --> 00:34:10,758
- Call it!
- I want nothin' to do with this.

331
00:34:10,967 --> 00:34:12,927
- Call it!
- Drop it, Wallace. Forget it.

332
00:34:13,052 --> 00:34:15,847
Get away from me.

333
00:34:28,985 --> 00:34:30,987
Call it.

334
00:35:08,107 --> 00:35:11,527
- Britt.
- Chris.

335
00:35:12,987 --> 00:35:15,489
Can I have a word with you?

336
00:35:24,999 --> 00:35:27,168
Did you have any luck?

337
00:35:27,293 --> 00:35:30,421
Found a man
who would have been perfect.

338
00:35:30,630 --> 00:35:35,218
Gun or knife, you couldn't
want any better. Wasn't interested.

339
00:35:35,426 --> 00:35:37,595
The money? It wasn't enough?

340
00:35:38,012 --> 00:35:40,223
He doesn't care a hoot about money.

341
00:35:40,431 --> 00:35:43,768
A man in this line of work
who doesn't care about money?

342
00:35:43,976 --> 00:35:48,773
Men in this line of work are not all alike.
Some care about nothing but money.

343
00:35:48,981 --> 00:35:52,318
Others, for reasons of their own,
enjoy only the danger.

344
00:35:52,527 --> 00:35:54,278
And the competition.

345
00:35:54,487 --> 00:35:59,283
If he's the best with a knife and a gun,
with whom does he compete?

346
00:35:59,408 --> 00:36:00,952
Himself.

347
00:36:01,160 --> 00:36:03,371
<i>(doors swing open)</i>

348
00:36:05,456 --> 00:36:07,416
You.

349
00:36:11,921 --> 00:36:15,341
- I've been looking for you!
- Uh-oh! What have we got here?

350
00:36:15,550 --> 00:36:17,343
Never mind.

351
00:36:17,426 --> 00:36:19,512
He knows.

352
00:36:20,346 --> 00:36:23,474
Clap hands, he says.

353
00:36:23,599 --> 00:36:27,228
Clap your hands,
and let's see how fast you are.

354
00:36:28,187 --> 00:36:30,147
Clap hands!

355
00:36:31,107 --> 00:36:34,110
A man comes to him...
cos he respects him,...

356
00:36:35,903 --> 00:36:39,031
..cos he'd be proud to work with him.

357
00:36:40,283 --> 00:36:44,328
He makes me look like two cents
with some damned kids' game!

358
00:36:44,537 --> 00:36:48,708
- Hey, kid, that's enough of that!
- You stay away from me, will ya?

359
00:36:55,923 --> 00:36:58,301
Come on, now,...

360
00:36:58,426 --> 00:37:00,928
..and let's see how fast you are.

361
00:37:03,014 --> 00:37:07,185
And no games, huh?
No clapping hands - none of that stuff!

362
00:37:08,019 --> 00:37:09,896
Just draw.

363
00:37:10,104 --> 00:37:12,607
Come on. Come on, draw!

364
00:37:13,733 --> 00:37:17,195
- Campesino. Come on!
- You say campesino to me?

365
00:37:18,237 --> 00:37:21,240
You get out of my way, you dirt farmer!

366
00:37:33,961 --> 00:37:36,672
You don't think I mean it, huh?

367
00:37:39,509 --> 00:37:41,886
You... think I'm just talking, huh?

368
00:37:58,486 --> 00:38:00,655
Hey... get up.

369
00:38:02,532 --> 00:38:04,825
Do you hear me?

370
00:38:07,453 --> 00:38:09,622
Get up and face me!

371
00:38:10,790 --> 00:38:12,959
Do you hear?

372
00:38:53,416 --> 00:38:55,418
Hey,...

373
00:38:58,421 --> 00:39:00,715
..give him my gun, huh?

374
00:39:14,812 --> 00:39:17,398
Sorry this happened, friend.

375
00:39:17,607 --> 00:39:20,026
Let him sleep it off.

376
00:39:20,109 --> 00:39:23,988
When he wakes up,
let him have his gun back.

377
00:39:24,197 --> 00:39:26,908
And give him a drink.

378
00:39:28,451 --> 00:39:31,370
I changed my mind.

379
00:39:39,003 --> 00:39:43,591
There's a man waiting in your room.
Said he was a friend of yours.

380
00:40:02,652 --> 00:40:04,946
Remember me?

381
00:40:11,202 --> 00:40:13,287
Yep.

382
00:40:13,412 --> 00:40:15,581
You need men to do a job in Mexico.

383
00:40:15,706 --> 00:40:17,792
- That's right.
- How long?

384
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:19,544
Four, six weeks.

385
00:40:19,752 --> 00:40:23,422
That ought to do it.
How much does the job pay?

386
00:40:25,091 --> 00:40:28,511
I thought you were looking
for the Johnson brothers.

387
00:40:28,636 --> 00:40:31,013
I found them.

388
00:40:31,138 --> 00:40:34,976
- How much does the job pay?
- 20. We leave tomorrow.

389
00:40:35,726 --> 00:40:38,646
I'll have the money before I leave.

390
00:40:38,855 --> 00:40:41,858
Lt'll just take care of
my last two days' rent.

391
00:40:41,983 --> 00:40:45,611
$20? You must be livin' in style.

392
00:40:45,736 --> 00:40:47,196
Yes.

393
00:40:47,405 --> 00:40:52,201
I have the most stylish corner
of the filthy storeroom out back.

394
00:40:52,285 --> 00:40:54,495
That, and one plate of beans:

395
00:40:55,413 --> 00:40:57,081
$10 a day.

396
00:40:57,290 --> 00:41:00,626
Yeah, things do get high when
they find out you're on the run.

397
00:41:00,751 --> 00:41:03,462
There's a dry wash south of town.

398
00:41:05,214 --> 00:41:07,508
Pick me up there.

399
00:41:14,515 --> 00:41:17,018
He's a good gun.

400
00:41:17,852 --> 00:41:20,563
And we aren't heading for a church social.

401
00:41:41,834 --> 00:41:43,794
Chris.

402
00:41:44,962 --> 00:41:47,757
Yeah. He picked us up at dawn.

403
00:41:49,634 --> 00:41:53,179
- Any idea who it is?
- Yeah. That kid from the saloon.

404
00:41:53,387 --> 00:41:57,767
- Won't take no for an answer.
- Doesn't show much sense, does he?

405
00:42:15,618 --> 00:42:18,746
I'm getting a stiff neck
keepin' track of him.

406
00:42:18,955 --> 00:42:21,958
If you can't forget him,
why don't you ride side-saddle?

407
00:42:22,166 --> 00:42:25,002
Ah, well... he won't last much longer.

408
00:42:25,086 --> 00:42:27,380
That so?

409
00:42:28,339 --> 00:42:32,301
Ridin' out there in all that dust
and heat - what a chucklehead!

410
00:42:32,510 --> 00:42:34,679
Yeah. Not smart like us(!)

411
00:42:36,681 --> 00:42:38,641
Yep.

412
00:42:45,523 --> 00:42:48,651
Suppose our friend over there
has got anything to eat?

413
00:42:48,776 --> 00:42:52,405
- How about I bring him some?
- Ah, it isn't food he's hungry for.

414
00:42:52,530 --> 00:42:56,784
Then let me tie a can to his tail. Right
now, he's like an itch I can't scratch.

415
00:42:56,993 --> 00:43:00,121
Ah, leave him alone. It's a free country.

416
00:43:00,329 --> 00:43:02,331
And it's his.

417
00:43:34,655 --> 00:43:38,492
You know, it's funny.
Now that he's gone, I kinda miss him.

418
00:45:23,514 --> 00:45:25,808
Where is everybody?

419
00:45:26,851 --> 00:45:31,105
- Where are they, Tomas?
- Luis! Asunción! Demetrio!

420
00:45:31,230 --> 00:45:34,650
Emilio! Sotero!
What kind of a reception is this?

421
00:45:34,775 --> 00:45:39,655
(Hilario) Come out! Come out and make
them welcome, before we die of shame.

422
00:45:39,780 --> 00:45:42,158
Hilario, stop your shouting.

423
00:45:50,625 --> 00:45:53,961
Do they call this a welcome?
What are they thinking of?

424
00:45:54,045 --> 00:45:56,464
Come in. You must be thirsty.

425
00:45:58,132 --> 00:46:01,260
You must excuse them.
They are farmers here.

426
00:46:01,344 --> 00:46:03,846
They are afraid of everyone
and everything.

427
00:46:03,971 --> 00:46:06,557
They are afraid of rain, and no rain...

428
00:46:06,766 --> 00:46:10,728
The summer may be too hot,
the winter - too cold.

429
00:46:10,853 --> 00:46:14,482
The sow has no pigs,
the farmer is afraid he may starve.

430
00:46:14,607 --> 00:46:17,610
She has too many,
he's afraid she may starve.

431
00:46:18,778 --> 00:46:23,241
There's no need to apologise.
We didn't expect flowers and speeches.

432
00:46:23,366 --> 00:46:27,203
Tomorrow is the anniversary
of the founding of the village.

433
00:46:27,411 --> 00:46:31,499
They will be celebrating -
then, you will see them in a better light.

We ride to this middle of nowhere.
We're ready to risk our lives to help you.

And you?

444
00:47:37,690 --> 00:47:39,901
You hide from us!

445
00:47:43,321 --> 00:47:44,989
Hide... from us!

446
00:47:50,411 --> 00:47:54,165
Ah... but it's a different story
when you're in danger, huh?

447
00:47:55,541 --> 00:47:58,044
You might lose your precious crops.

448
00:47:58,252 --> 00:48:00,755
Then you flock to us. Huh?

449
00:48:04,383 --> 00:48:07,929
Well... we're here, my compadres and l.

450
00:48:08,888 --> 00:48:11,682
And here we stay.

451
00:48:12,517 --> 00:48:14,393
And you?

452
00:48:14,519 --> 00:48:18,898
You prove to us
that you're worth fighting for.

453
00:48:19,106 --> 00:48:22,944
Now get back to your houses,
back to work. Go on! Go back.

454
00:48:23,069 --> 00:48:27,740
We'll let you know when to fight and how
to fight. Go back! All of you, go back!

455
00:48:27,865 --> 00:48:29,742
Go back!

456
00:48:42,255 --> 00:48:44,340

As a matter of fact, I've been in some

But this is the first time I've been

we can have quite a social life here(!)

Oh, it's not so bad. I fell in with a fast

00:51:11,571 --> 00:51:12,488
Hilario!

470
00:51:12,697 --> 00:51:14,699
<i>(whispering)</i>

471
00:52:06,209 --> 00:52:08,294
Britt.

472
00:52:09,128 --> 00:52:13,799
The boy saw three of Calvera's men.
The horses are in the arroyo.

473
00:52:13,925 --> 00:52:16,093
<i>(Britt)</i> Lee.

474
00:52:16,219 --> 00:52:19,222
- Get one alive.
- Yes.

475
00:52:20,598 --> 00:52:22,767
I'll show you where.

476
00:52:23,601 --> 00:52:26,729
Rico, he knows where the arroyo is.

477
00:52:40,493 --> 00:52:42,495
<i>(festivities continue)</i>

478
00:52:44,872 --> 00:52:46,874
<i>(whispers)</i>

479
00:55:40,047 --> 00:55:44,135
- I'm sorry, Britt. I didn't mean to spoil it.
- Shut up!

480
00:55:53,102 --> 00:55:57,773
Oh... That... that was
the greatest shot I've ever seen.

481
00:55:57,899 --> 00:55:59,859
The worst.

482
00:56:00,067 --> 00:56:02,361
I was aiming at the horse.

483
00:56:24,175 --> 00:56:27,386
Three men were sent by Calvera to spy.

484
00:56:27,512 --> 00:56:30,306
It's almost certain they saw us.

485
00:56:36,896 --> 00:56:39,398
Whatever they learned
will be buried with them.

486
00:56:39,607 --> 00:56:41,776
<i>¡Válgame Dios!</i>
If he comes now...

487
00:56:42,109 --> 00:56:46,781
He'd never send men ahead
if he was near enough to see for himself.

488
00:56:46,906 --> 00:56:51,702
So we have time to get ready.
And we have something else - surprise.

489
00:56:52,411 --> 00:56:57,124
If he rides in with no idea of
the reception we can prepare for him,...

490
00:56:57,208 --> 00:57:00,962
..I promise you, we'll all teach him
something about the price of corn.

491
00:57:01,796 --> 00:57:03,798
Aim,...

492
00:57:04,006 --> 00:57:06,175
..squeeze,...

493
00:57:06,300 --> 00:57:09,220
..cock.

494
00:57:09,428 --> 00:57:11,180
Aim,...

495
00:57:11,305 --> 00:57:13,266
..squeeze,...

496
00:57:14,100 --> 00:57:15,351
..cock.

497
00:57:16,519 --> 00:57:21,607
Settle down. Now, you miss the first
chance, you may not get a second.

498
00:57:23,276 --> 00:57:27,446
Get that butt tight in your shoulder.
If you don't, two things will happen.

499
00:57:27,572 --> 00:57:31,117
One: you'll waste a bullet.
Two: you'll break your arm.

500
00:57:31,325 --> 00:57:36,747
Now, close your eye.
Aim from here, to here, to the target.

501
00:57:38,416 --> 00:57:39,542
Fire.

502
00:57:39,750 --> 00:57:41,627
That rock?

503
00:57:41,752 --> 00:57:44,046
No, that man you're gonna kill.

504
00:57:47,884 --> 00:57:49,760
Good!

505
00:57:49,886 --> 00:57:52,471
If only we had more guns,
think what we could do!

506
00:57:52,597 --> 00:57:55,308
- You'll get more guns.
- How?

507
00:57:55,391 --> 00:57:58,519
The same way you got these.
Calvera's men.

508
00:57:58,644 --> 00:58:01,147
The ones who spied on us brought them.

509
00:58:01,355 --> 00:58:03,649
Like three kings bearing gifts.

510
00:58:12,074 --> 00:58:15,745
If Calvera does not come now,
after all of this,...

511
00:58:15,828 --> 00:58:18,039
..what a waste!

512
00:58:24,295 --> 00:58:26,797
A pretty foxy fellow, this Calvera, eh?

513
00:58:26,881 --> 00:58:29,926
Señor, not a fox. A coyote!

514
00:58:32,011 --> 00:58:35,139
How did he ever find out
about the gold mine?

515
00:58:35,348 --> 00:58:37,308
Gold mine?

516
00:58:38,893 --> 00:58:43,773
- What gold mine, señor?
- You know, the one in the mountains.

517
00:58:43,981 --> 00:58:48,361
- In our mountains?
- We never had a gold mine around here.

518
00:58:49,529 --> 00:58:53,157
Say, come to think of it,
it was a silver mine.

519
00:58:53,366 --> 00:58:57,245
- Whatever happened to it?
- We have no silver mine either.

520
00:58:57,328 --> 00:59:01,290
- I mean in the old days.
- Not at any time.

521
00:59:01,415 --> 00:59:04,961
Where did you hear
of this gold and silver, hm?

522
00:59:06,420 --> 00:59:09,966
All right, come on, boys.
More work, less talk, huh?

523
00:59:53,426 --> 00:59:55,511
<i>Toro.</i>

524
00:59:58,347 --> 01:00:00,224

525
01:00:00,308 --> 01:00:02,518
<i>¡ Toro!</i>

01:00:02,935 --> 01:00:05,313

<i>(twig snaps)</i>

530
01:01:24,976 --> 01:01:28,437
You do anything to me
and I'll kill you while you are doing it.

531
01:01:28,521 --> 01:01:33,234
- You almost took my eye out!
- Let me go. Let me go!

532
01:01:33,442 --> 01:01:36,237
Oh, you bite me and I'll bite you!

533
01:01:37,071 --> 01:01:39,365
I got a good mind
to throw you in the water.

534
01:01:39,574 --> 01:01:42,201
Smash you with a rock!
Cut your head off!

535
01:01:42,285 --> 01:01:44,579
Shut up. Shut up!

536
01:01:47,498 --> 01:01:51,586
- Where are the others? Huh?
- I'll never tell you.

537
01:02:26,412 --> 01:02:28,706
Look what I found.

538
01:02:37,965 --> 01:02:41,302
- Who is she?
- From our village.

539
01:02:46,516 --> 01:02:49,560
So that's where they were. You hid them.

540
01:02:49,769 --> 01:02:52,355
Sure they hid them.
But she won't tell where.

541
01:02:52,480 --> 01:02:55,900
They're afraid.
She's afraid of me, you, him... all of us.

542
01:02:56,108 --> 01:02:59,862
Farmers! Their families
told them we'd rape them.

543
01:03:01,864 --> 01:03:04,158
Well, we might.

544
01:03:04,242 --> 01:03:08,621
In my opinion, though, you might have
given us the benefit of the doubt.

545
01:03:08,829 --> 01:03:11,332
But... just as you please.

546
01:03:12,500 --> 01:03:16,128
As long as you were out there,
why didn't you bring 'em all in?

547
01:03:16,254 --> 01:03:18,840
What for? Leave them out there.

548
01:03:18,965 --> 01:03:21,551
Let Calvera find them.
He'll take good care of them.

549
01:03:21,676 --> 01:03:22,802
Bring them in.

550
01:03:23,010 --> 01:03:25,012
Show him the way.

551
01:03:25,221 --> 01:03:27,181
Ma'am.

552
01:03:33,145 --> 01:03:35,940
Come on, little angel(!)

553
01:03:42,947 --> 01:03:44,907
Gently, boy.

554
01:03:45,867 --> 01:03:47,827
Gently.

555
01:04:27,241 --> 01:04:32,663
I can't tell you how wonderful it was
for you señoritas to fix dinner for us.

556
01:04:44,967 --> 01:04:48,012
- How's the food?
- Great.

557
01:04:48,221 --> 01:04:51,766
Chicken enchiladas, carne asada
and Spanish rice. Looks good.

558
01:04:51,974 --> 01:04:55,311
These people really know how to cook.
Dig in, there's tons of it.

559
01:04:55,394 --> 01:04:58,940
Do you know what the villagers
have been eating since we got here?

560
01:04:59,065 --> 01:05:01,859
Tortillas and a few beans, that's all.

561
01:05:05,404 --> 01:05:07,823
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

562
01:05:08,032 --> 01:05:10,618
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

563
01:05:10,952 --> 01:05:12,912
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

564
01:05:13,037 --> 01:05:15,122
Do you have an older,
grateful sister at home?

565
01:05:15,331 --> 01:05:18,960
- No, sir. Many thanks.
- You're welcome.

566
01:05:19,085 --> 01:05:20,419
Many thanks.

567
01:05:20,837 --> 01:05:23,548
One, two, three, four.

568
01:05:24,090 --> 01:05:26,801
One, two, three, four.

569
01:05:27,218 --> 01:05:29,929
One, two, three, four.

570
01:05:30,221 --> 01:05:33,140
One, two, three, four.

571
01:05:33,474 --> 01:05:36,477
One, two, three, four.

572
01:05:36,602 --> 01:05:37,937
One, two,...

573
01:05:38,145 --> 01:05:39,397
..three, four.

574
01:05:39,605 --> 01:05:42,441
One, two, three, four.

575
01:05:42,859 --> 01:05:44,944
Squeeze.

576
01:05:45,653 --> 01:05:48,990
Miguel, didn't I tell you to squeeze? Hm?

577
01:05:49,198 --> 01:05:51,617
Just like when
you're milking a goat, Miguel.

578
01:05:51,826 --> 01:05:55,162
- It's that I get excited.
- Well, don't get excited!

579
01:05:55,872 --> 01:05:59,834
Now, this time, squeeze.
Slowly, but squeeze.

580
01:05:59,959 --> 01:06:02,253
All right... squeeze.

581
01:06:06,507 --> 01:06:08,176
Squeeze!

582
01:06:08,301 --> 01:06:11,929
I'll tell you what. Don't shoot the gun.

583
01:06:12,054 --> 01:06:15,892
You take the gun like this
and you use it like a club. All right?

584
01:06:16,017 --> 01:06:16,934
Right.

585
01:06:17,143 --> 01:06:19,145
Flaco!

586
01:06:19,979 --> 01:06:21,939
<i>Muchas gracias.</i>

587
01:06:50,510 --> 01:06:51,886
Good afternoon.

588
01:06:52,094 --> 01:06:53,346
Howdy.

589
01:06:53,429 --> 01:06:56,140
We've come to move you into the village.

590
01:06:56,265 --> 01:07:00,311
- Move into the village? Me?
- Everybody who lives outside.

591
01:07:00,520 --> 01:07:02,313
Oh, no.

592
01:07:02,522 --> 01:07:04,482
We can't protect you out here.

593
01:07:04,607 --> 01:07:07,318
Rojas is makin' room for you in his home.

594
01:07:07,527 --> 01:07:11,572
Rojas? His conversation
would bore me to death!

595
01:07:13,157 --> 01:07:15,243
Yeah, well, uh...

596
01:07:16,577 --> 01:07:19,288
- ..maybe somebody else, huh?
- They are all farmers.

597
01:07:19,497 --> 01:07:23,376
Farmers talk of nothing
but fertiliser and women.

598
01:07:23,459 --> 01:07:27,421
I've never shared
their enthusiasm for fertiliser.

599
01:07:27,547 --> 01:07:32,426
As for women...
I became indifferent when I was 83.

600
01:07:33,386 --> 01:07:35,555
I am staying here.

601
01:07:38,891 --> 01:07:42,228
Yeah, well, uh... what are you
gonna do when Calvera comes?

602
01:07:42,353 --> 01:07:45,273
At my age, a little excitement is welcome.

603
01:07:46,107 --> 01:07:48,484
Don't worry. Why would he kill me?

604
01:07:49,026 --> 01:07:51,737
Bullets cost money.

605
01:07:51,821 --> 01:07:54,949
All right. Have it your way.

606
01:07:55,575 --> 01:07:57,785
You worry about yourself.

607
01:07:57,869 --> 01:08:00,079
Are you ready for him?

608
01:08:00,162 --> 01:08:02,373
What if he comes now, eh?

609
01:08:02,582 --> 01:08:05,376
It's like that fella
who fell off a ten-storey building.

610
01:08:05,501 --> 01:08:07,253
What about him?

611
01:08:07,461 --> 01:08:11,632
As he was falling, people on each floor
heard him say "So far, so good."

612
01:08:11,757 --> 01:08:13,926
So far, so good!

613
01:08:41,454 --> 01:08:44,165
First of all, they'll see that ditch.

614
01:08:44,373 --> 01:08:46,584
More water for the corn.

615
01:08:50,129 --> 01:08:54,383
- Awful lot of new walls.
- Civic improvements.

616
01:08:55,843 --> 01:08:57,929
Hey, Chris,...

617
01:08:58,971 --> 01:09:01,474
..what about that net, eh?

618
01:09:01,599 --> 01:09:04,310
Well, if he's not looking for it...

619
01:09:04,393 --> 01:09:06,687
If he rides in unsuspecting.

620
01:09:07,522 --> 01:09:09,607
If, brother!

621
01:09:09,732 --> 01:09:11,692
If!

622
01:09:13,361 --> 01:09:15,238
Yeah.

623
01:09:15,446 --> 01:09:17,448
Yeah!

624
01:11:50,935 --> 01:11:55,731
I should have guessed. When my men
didn't come back, I should have guessed.

625
01:11:56,774 --> 01:11:59,986
- How many of you did they hire?
- Enough.

626
01:12:06,158 --> 01:12:08,035
New wall!

627
01:12:08,244 --> 01:12:10,621
There are lots of new walls. All around.

628
01:12:14,584 --> 01:12:16,794
They won't keep me out.

629
01:12:17,003 --> 01:12:19,589
They were built to keep you in.

630
01:12:29,724 --> 01:12:32,435
Did you hear that? We're trapped!

631
01:12:33,269 --> 01:12:36,606
All forty of us! By these three.

632
01:12:36,814 --> 01:12:40,359
Or is it four? They couldn't afford
to hire more than that.

633
01:12:40,443 --> 01:12:43,070
We come cheaper by the bunch.

634
01:12:43,279 --> 01:12:44,947
Five!

635
01:12:45,031 --> 01:12:47,742
Even five won't give us too much trouble.

636
01:12:49,327 --> 01:12:52,246
There won't be any trouble -
if you ride on.

637
01:12:52,330 --> 01:12:53,789
Ride on?

638
01:12:53,915 --> 01:12:58,294
I'm going into the hills for the winter.
Where am I going to get food for my men?

639
01:12:58,377 --> 01:13:00,588
Buy it or grow it.

640
01:13:00,796 --> 01:13:03,090
Or maybe even work for it!

641
01:13:03,299 --> 01:13:05,176
Seven!

642
01:13:05,384 --> 01:13:08,596
Somehow, I don't think
you've solved my problem.

643
01:13:08,721 --> 01:13:11,432
Solving your problems isn't our line.

644
01:13:11,516 --> 01:13:13,809
We deal in lead, friend.

645
01:13:15,061 --> 01:13:18,105
So do l. We're in the same business, huh?

646
01:13:19,023 --> 01:13:22,902
- Only as competitors.
- Why not as partners?

647
01:13:24,028 --> 01:13:26,113
Suppose I offer you equal shares?

648
01:13:26,239 --> 01:13:29,784
- In what?
- Everything. To the last grain.

649
01:13:29,867 --> 01:13:32,787
And the people in the village?
What about them?

650
01:13:34,872 --> 01:13:36,874
I leave it to you.

651
01:13:37,083 --> 01:13:40,503
Can men of our profession
worry about things like that?

652
01:13:40,711 --> 01:13:43,548
May even be sacrilegious.

653
01:13:45,007 --> 01:13:50,096
If God didn't want them sheared,
he would not have made them sheep.

654
01:13:50,221 --> 01:13:53,224
- What do you say?
- Ride on.

655
01:13:58,020 --> 01:14:00,314
You hear that, Sotero?

656
01:14:01,357 --> 01:14:03,776
You hear what he said?

657
01:14:03,860 --> 01:14:05,736
Ride on.

658
01:14:05,945 --> 01:14:07,947
To me!

659
01:14:11,284 --> 01:14:15,037
You tell him to ride on
before I become angry.

660
01:14:15,246 --> 01:14:17,331
Him, and the others!

661
01:14:19,208 --> 01:14:21,294
Because, if I leave with empty hands,...

662
01:14:21,377 --> 01:14:26,090
..everybody in this village
will answer to me - when I come back!

663
01:14:26,174 --> 01:14:29,510
- You won't come back.
- Why not?

664
01:14:29,719 --> 01:14:31,929
You won't have any guns.

665
01:14:32,763 --> 01:14:35,558
Take them off right now and drop them.

666
01:14:40,062 --> 01:14:42,982
Generosity. That was my first mistake!

667
01:14:43,900 --> 01:14:49,238
I leave these people a little bit extra
and they hire these men to make trouble.

668
01:14:49,447 --> 01:14:54,327
It shows you... sooner or later,
you must answer for every good deed.

669
01:17:28,856 --> 01:17:30,650
You were safe.

670
01:17:30,858 --> 01:17:35,446
I was face to face with them as they
rode toward me. Ten of them, screaming.

671
01:17:35,530 --> 01:17:39,283
- The last time you told it, it was five!
- They multiply like rabbits!

672
01:17:39,408 --> 01:17:41,494
Ten. Ten!

673
01:17:46,290 --> 01:17:48,042
Yeh-hey!

674
01:17:48,167 --> 01:17:51,587
- They got a good kick in the behind.
- If they try it again, they'll get another!

675
01:17:51,712 --> 01:17:56,300
- We'll tear them to pieces.
- We'll bury them all. Calvera too, huh?

676
01:17:59,095 --> 01:18:00,972
Any sign of 'em?

677
01:18:01,097 --> 01:18:04,517
- No.
- That is bad luck.

678
01:18:04,642 --> 01:18:08,062
Can you imagine? I knew him
when he was a mouse!

679
01:18:11,399 --> 01:18:14,527
I was never so frightened in my life.
My knees were like jelly.

680
01:18:14,652 --> 01:18:18,823
- I would never have guessed it.
- Well, he'll leave us alone from now on.

681
01:18:18,906 --> 01:18:20,783
- You think so?
- Of course.

682
01:18:20,908 --> 01:18:23,828
He'll go away. There are other villages -

683
01:18:24,036 --> 01:18:26,622
other villages that don't sting
the way we do.

684
01:18:26,747 --> 01:18:27,874
Señor!

685
01:18:36,132 --> 01:18:39,260
Neighbours... I drink to our friends.

686
01:18:40,303 --> 01:18:45,600
They armed us, fought at our sides,
and will forever live in our hearts.

687
01:18:45,725 --> 01:18:48,019
<i>(gunshots)</i>

688
01:18:56,861 --> 01:18:59,280
They haven't gone, then.

689
01:19:02,909 --> 01:19:04,994
<i>(gunshots)</i>

690
01:19:14,378 --> 01:19:17,507
- See the gun flashin'?
- No.

691
01:19:17,632 --> 01:19:18,549
<i>(gunshot)</i>

692
01:19:18,758 --> 01:19:21,802
- I make it two of them.
- Three.

693
01:19:26,390 --> 01:19:28,559
Fool kid's gonna get his head blown off.

694
01:19:42,949 --> 01:19:44,825
Chico! Stay put.

695
01:19:48,287 --> 01:19:50,873
- Three?
- Three.

696
01:19:56,420 --> 01:19:58,798
O'Reilly? Do you see them?

697
01:19:58,923 --> 01:20:02,885
No... They're too far back in the trees.

698
01:20:03,302 --> 01:20:05,054
- Chris.
- Yeah?

699
01:20:05,263 --> 01:20:09,851
Try and make it up to those rocks.
I'll cover you.

700
01:20:14,438 --> 01:20:16,941
<i>(Chris)</i>
Chico... cover the back door.

701
01:20:46,345 --> 01:20:48,347
Get back!

702
01:20:49,682 --> 01:20:51,976
Get back! Go on!

703
01:20:52,101 --> 01:20:54,604
What's the matter?
Don't you hear so good?

704
01:20:54,687 --> 01:20:57,106
Get down. Now stay down!

705
01:21:01,485 --> 01:21:03,571
Crazy kids! You might have been hurt.

706
01:21:03,779 --> 01:21:06,991
- So might you.
- It's not the same thing.

707
01:21:07,200 --> 01:21:10,536
- This is my work.
- It's our work, too.

708
01:21:10,661 --> 01:21:14,290
Everyone tells us
"Hide! Get back! Stay out of sight!"

709
01:21:14,415 --> 01:21:18,044
- But we're not afraid.
- He's very brave. It's the truth.

710
01:21:18,169 --> 01:21:22,131
So is he. We all are -
every boy in the village.

711
01:21:26,719 --> 01:21:30,139
We had a meeting
and we drew straws and we got you.

712
01:21:31,933 --> 01:21:34,727
You got me?
What d'you mean, you got me?

713
01:21:34,852 --> 01:21:37,230
If you get killed, we avenge you.

714
01:21:37,438 --> 01:21:41,817
And we see to it that there's always
fresh flowers on your grave.

715
01:21:45,071 --> 01:21:47,782
That's a mighty big comfort(!)

716
01:21:47,990 --> 01:21:50,910
I told you he would appreciate that.

717
01:21:50,993 --> 01:21:54,455
Don't you kids be too disappointed
if your plans don't work out.

718
01:21:54,664 --> 01:21:57,583
We won't. If you stay alive,
we'll be just as happy.

719
01:21:57,792 --> 01:21:59,877
Maybe even happier.

720
01:22:00,503 --> 01:22:02,463
Maybe.

721
01:22:20,314 --> 01:22:22,817
Can you see them?

722
01:22:22,900 --> 01:22:24,986
No.

723
01:22:33,452 --> 01:22:35,830
Do your, uh,...

724
01:22:36,038 --> 01:22:38,666
..hands sweat before a fight?

725
01:22:42,086 --> 01:22:45,840
- Every time.
- Mine are sweatin' now.

726
01:22:46,883 --> 01:22:48,968
Funny...

727
01:22:49,927 --> 01:22:52,513
Hands sweat,...

728
01:22:52,638 --> 01:22:55,224
..mouth is dry.

729
01:22:55,349 --> 01:22:58,686
You'd think it would be
the other way around.

730
01:23:02,523 --> 01:23:05,985
Does my... talking annoy you?

731
01:23:07,653 --> 01:23:08,988
Mm-mm.

732
01:23:09,739 --> 01:23:11,824
It's because I'm...

733
01:23:13,159 --> 01:23:15,369
..I'm frightened, you know?

734
01:23:16,621 --> 01:23:20,458
Yeah. I guess you kinda wish
you'd given your crops to Calvera, huh?

735
01:23:20,666 --> 01:23:22,668
Yes...

736
01:23:24,003 --> 01:23:26,088
..and no.

737
01:23:27,048 --> 01:23:29,217
Both at the same time.

738
01:23:31,010 --> 01:23:32,970
Yes, when I think of,...

739
01:23:33,095 --> 01:23:35,181
..of what he might do.

740
01:23:37,266 --> 01:23:41,938
No, when I remember the feeling
in my chest this morning...

741
01:23:42,146 --> 01:23:44,232
..as I saw him run away.

742
01:23:45,191 --> 01:23:47,151
From us.

743
01:23:48,319 --> 01:23:50,279
Man,...

744
01:23:51,322 --> 01:23:54,033
..that's a feeling worth dying for!

745
01:23:54,659 --> 01:23:57,787
Have you ever... felt something like that?

746
01:23:58,120 --> 01:24:00,414
Not for a long, long time.

747
01:24:03,000 --> 01:24:05,002
I, uh,...

748
01:24:05,628 --> 01:24:07,713
..envy you.

749
01:24:18,432 --> 01:24:21,352
- What are you doing here?
- You shouldn't do things like you did.

750
01:24:21,477 --> 01:24:24,272
- Go back.
- You mustn't take foolish chances.

751
01:24:24,480 --> 01:24:26,899
All right, I won't. But go back.

752
01:24:30,236 --> 01:24:33,030
- Does it hurt?
- What?

753
01:24:45,459 --> 01:24:47,211
No.

754
01:24:48,045 --> 01:24:50,882
I'm sorry I did it, but I thought...

755
01:24:52,008 --> 01:24:55,553
- You know what I thought.
- Yes, yes. I know.

756
01:24:56,095 --> 01:24:59,223
I wasn't afraid of you. It's my father.

757
01:25:00,474 --> 01:25:02,768
He says "Stay away from those men."

758
01:25:03,895 --> 01:25:06,314
"They are brutes. They are cruel."

759
01:25:06,397 --> 01:25:09,317
He's right. Do you know that? He's right.

760
01:25:10,902 --> 01:25:13,070
Well... go back home now.

761
01:25:14,238 --> 01:25:15,907
He is wrong.

762
01:25:18,910 --> 01:25:20,995
Well... go home anyway,...

763
01:25:21,120 --> 01:25:23,414
..before he finds out you're here.

764
01:25:24,874 --> 01:25:27,043
He already knows.

765
01:25:27,168 --> 01:25:30,588
He said he'd punish me
for being so shameless.

766
01:25:31,756 --> 01:25:33,716
But I don't care.

767
01:25:46,020 --> 01:25:48,856
They got them. They got them all!

768
01:25:48,940 --> 01:25:51,442
- Result.
- Do you think they'll try that again?

769
01:25:51,567 --> 01:25:56,239
I doubt it. For all they know,
we're still out there ready to jump them.

770
01:25:56,364 --> 01:25:58,658
He didn't go. Calvera didn't go?

771
01:25:58,866 --> 01:26:01,369
Did you think it would be that easy?

772
01:26:02,620 --> 01:26:05,831
- What do we do now?
- Well, what do you say?

773
01:26:06,040 --> 01:26:09,168
- Me?
- We work for you, you know.

774
01:26:09,919 --> 01:26:12,505
What else is there to do but... wait?

775
01:26:13,130 --> 01:26:15,550
- It's Calvera's move.
- Right.

776
01:26:15,758 --> 01:26:18,761
Now you'd better replace the guards.
They must be tired.

777
01:26:18,886 --> 01:26:20,638
- If you were Calvera,...
- Yes?

778
01:26:20,763 --> 01:26:25,852
..you'd go away, wouldn't you?
If you'd paid the price we make him pay.

779
01:26:25,977 --> 01:26:28,271
- Yes, I would, only...
- Only what?

780
01:26:29,730 --> 01:26:31,607
Only I'm not Calvera.

781
01:26:32,942 --> 01:26:35,862
Take the rifles and the bandoleras
and pass 'em out.

782
01:26:35,987 --> 01:26:38,364
Now, let's get out there on duty.

783
01:26:49,542 --> 01:26:51,419
Food, woman.

784
01:26:51,627 --> 01:26:53,588
They'll be hungry.

785
01:27:19,572 --> 01:27:22,158
That was... that was the greatest...

786
01:27:22,283 --> 01:27:24,785
New hat for you, sonny.

787
01:27:26,746 --> 01:27:28,831
Hey!

788
01:27:29,373 --> 01:27:32,710
- How do I look? Huh?
- Big improvement.

789
01:27:37,507 --> 01:27:41,135
You know what? They'll make up a song
about you and this hat.

790
01:27:41,344 --> 01:27:46,557
Villages like this make up a song about
every big thing. They sing them for years.

791
01:27:46,766 --> 01:27:49,810
- Do you think it's worth it?
- Don't you?

792
01:27:49,894 --> 01:27:55,107
It's only a matter of knowing how
to shoot a gun. Nothing big about that.

793
01:28:00,029 --> 01:28:02,532
Hey... how can you talk like this?

794
01:28:03,574 --> 01:28:07,828
Your gun has got you
everything you have. lsn't that true?

795
01:28:08,162 --> 01:28:10,248
Mm?

796
01:28:10,456 --> 01:28:13,876
- Well, isn't that true?
- Yeah, sure. Everything.

797
01:28:14,001 --> 01:28:18,673
After a while you can call bartenders
by their first name. Maybe 200 of 'em.

798
01:28:18,798 --> 01:28:23,052
Rented rooms you live in: 500.
Meals you eat in hash houses: 1,000.

799
01:28:23,177 --> 01:28:25,763
Home: none. Wife: none. Kids:

800
01:28:27,223 --> 01:28:29,433
none.

801
01:28:29,642 --> 01:28:31,727
Prospects: zero.

802
01:28:33,062 --> 01:28:37,024
- Suppose I left anything out?
- Yeah.

803
01:28:37,233 --> 01:28:39,861
Places you are tied down to: none.

804
01:28:40,695 --> 01:28:43,072
People with a hold on you: none.

805
01:28:43,197 --> 01:28:45,908
Men you step aside for: none.

806
01:28:47,034 --> 01:28:49,245
Insults swallowed:

807
01:28:49,453 --> 01:28:51,205
none.

808
01:28:51,330 --> 01:28:53,624
Enemies: none.

809
01:28:55,918 --> 01:28:58,629
No enemies?

810
01:29:00,506 --> 01:29:01,757
Alive.

811
01:29:01,966 --> 01:29:05,511
Well! This is the kind
of arithmetic I like!

812
01:29:05,720 --> 01:29:07,889
Yeah, so did I at your age.

813
01:29:08,014 --> 01:29:10,725
Give these to someone
who knows how to use them.

814
01:29:10,808 --> 01:29:13,102
Yeah.

815
01:29:13,227 --> 01:29:16,230
Why don't you ask Calvera
what he has in mind for tonight?

816
01:29:16,439 --> 01:29:19,775
Yes, do that. And I'll
write a song for you myself.

817
01:29:26,782 --> 01:29:29,285
Andrés,
Lorenzo and Felipe never came back.

818
01:29:29,493 --> 01:29:31,454
That's three.

819
01:29:33,039 --> 01:29:35,833
- Armando in the plaza.
- That's four.

820
01:29:37,210 --> 01:29:41,255
And Jorge and Memo in the pass, where
they were caught by that cursed net.

821
01:29:41,380 --> 01:29:42,507
Damn them!

822
01:29:42,715 --> 01:29:45,134
Five and six.

823
01:29:45,343 --> 01:29:48,346
Emilio going over the wall.

824
01:29:48,471 --> 01:29:50,014
Seven.

825
01:29:50,139 --> 01:29:52,517
José near the fountain.

826
01:29:57,522 --> 01:29:59,190
Eight.

827
01:29:59,315 --> 01:30:01,901
Gregorio near the fountain.

828
01:30:07,865 --> 01:30:09,951
That's nine.

829
01:30:11,494 --> 01:30:13,287
Nine.

830
01:30:13,371 --> 01:30:15,581
Fortuno by the water ditch.

831
01:30:15,665 --> 01:30:19,544
Rico in the fields,
where they slashed him to pieces!

832
01:30:21,003 --> 01:30:22,964
That's... 10 and 11.

833
01:30:25,591 --> 01:30:26,843
Go on.

834
01:30:26,926 --> 01:30:28,719
Talk.

835
01:30:28,928 --> 01:30:30,888
Talk! Talk!

836
01:30:33,599 --> 01:30:36,936
They're all dead anyway.
Forget about them.

837
01:30:37,353 --> 01:30:40,898
There's still plenty of us here...
to make them pay.

838
01:30:42,567 --> 01:30:44,861
Our friends down below.

839
01:30:50,908 --> 01:30:52,910
<i>(moaning)</i>

840
01:30:56,247 --> 01:30:58,207
Please, no!

841
01:31:11,053 --> 01:31:13,431
It's all right. You're all right.

842
01:31:13,639 --> 01:31:16,559
You had a dream. Just a bad dream.

843
01:31:23,024 --> 01:31:25,234
Have no fear.

844
01:31:27,820 --> 01:31:29,822
"Have no fear"?

845
01:31:32,325 --> 01:31:34,493
My very words.

846
01:31:35,536 --> 01:31:37,622
10,000 times a day.

847
01:31:38,372 --> 01:31:40,958
Señor, don't punish yourself.

848
01:31:41,167 --> 01:31:45,671
A man who has fought so many times...
You must have great courage.

849
01:31:54,722 --> 01:31:57,225
Until the day you lose your nerve.

850
01:31:58,893 --> 01:32:00,895
You feel it.

851
01:32:02,355 --> 01:32:04,315
And then you wait,...

852
01:32:05,483 --> 01:32:08,819
..for the bullet in the gun
that is faster than yours.

853
01:32:08,903 --> 01:32:12,865
- Señor, don't.
- And the lies you tell, to fool yourself.

854
01:32:14,742 --> 01:32:17,245
No enemies:

855
01:32:17,370 --> 01:32:19,455
alive.

856
01:32:21,624 --> 01:32:24,752
I have lost count of my enemies.

857
01:32:25,711 --> 01:32:29,257
- But you're with friends now.
- Yes.

858
01:32:29,340 --> 01:32:32,051
The final, supreme idiocy:

859
01:32:33,511 --> 01:32:35,721
comin' here to hide.

860
01:32:37,473 --> 01:32:42,395
The deserter... hidin' out
in the middle of a battlefield.

861
01:32:59,912 --> 01:33:01,998
One.

862
01:33:03,666 --> 01:33:07,086
There was a time
when I woulda caught all three.

863
01:33:20,141 --> 01:33:22,643
We know what fear is.

864
01:33:22,852 --> 01:33:25,354
We live with it all our lives.

865
01:33:26,689 --> 01:33:28,900
Only the dead are without fear.

866
01:33:39,827 --> 01:33:41,829
Rico!

867
01:33:46,709 --> 01:33:47,752
Rico!

868
01:33:47,877 --> 01:33:50,254
One minute, Mother!

869
01:33:50,796 --> 01:33:54,634
Ten minutes to pretend we're asleep,
and then we'll be back on duty.

870
01:33:54,842 --> 01:33:58,387
- All right, Bernardo?
- Yes, but not you, Juan.

871
01:33:58,513 --> 01:34:00,681
You're too young. Come on.

872
01:34:04,852 --> 01:34:06,854
Bernardo O'Reilly!

873
01:34:07,563 --> 01:34:09,857
You've been adopted.

874
01:34:10,900 --> 01:34:12,568
Yeah, it's my real name.

875
01:34:12,693 --> 01:34:17,073
Mexican on one side, Irish on the other,
and me in the middle.

876
01:34:20,618 --> 01:34:22,995
Now, watch carefully. Here we go.

877
01:34:24,872 --> 01:34:27,708
See? All three, right side up.

878
01:34:27,792 --> 01:34:31,128
- Think you can do it?
- Of course. That's very easy.

879
01:34:31,337 --> 01:34:35,007
Would you, uh... care to make
a friendly wager? A little bet?

880
01:34:35,216 --> 01:34:38,219
- You know we have no money.
- It doesn't have to be money.

881
01:34:38,344 --> 01:34:42,598
Whatever you have hidden away,
buried out where Calvera can't find it.

882
01:34:42,807 --> 01:34:44,267
- Like jewels.
- Jewels?

883
01:34:44,392 --> 01:34:48,980
Yeah. They tell me a lotta precious stones
have been dug out of the mountains.

884
01:34:49,063 --> 01:34:51,774
Opals, emeralds... sapphires.

885
01:34:51,983 --> 01:34:55,528
- Oh, yes. Yes, that's very true.
- There's no denyin' it.

886
01:34:55,736 --> 01:34:58,573
<i>(Harry)</i> Well, then!

887
01:35:01,075 --> 01:35:04,203
No! When you're finished,
they should all be right side up.

888
01:35:04,412 --> 01:35:06,581
Let me try it again, eh?

889
01:35:11,294 --> 01:35:14,422
About those precious stones...
Where are they found?

890
01:35:14,505 --> 01:35:17,216
(Flaco) As you say, señor,
in the mountains.

891
01:35:17,341 --> 01:35:20,553
- Where in the mountains?
- That I couldn't tell you.

892
01:35:20,678 --> 01:35:22,430
There! I got it!

893
01:35:22,638 --> 01:35:25,683
Never mind that. Why can't you tell me?

894
01:35:25,892 --> 01:35:28,477
Because I never have found
any precious stones.

895
01:35:28,686 --> 01:35:34,525
Wait. You mean Aztec treasure buried in
the hills, from when the Spaniards came?

896
01:35:34,734 --> 01:35:37,987
That's exactly what I mean.
Aztec treasure. Have you found some?

897
01:35:39,530 --> 01:35:42,366
Would to God we had!
I would not be sitting here.

898
01:35:42,575 --> 01:35:45,286
I'd be living in a big city, in a palace.

899
01:35:45,494 --> 01:35:48,915
Then tell me this - how come Calvera
keeps hangin' around here?

900
01:35:49,123 --> 01:35:53,085
Calvera... We've seen the end of him.
He'll be gone in the morning.

901
01:35:53,294 --> 01:35:55,379
No, he will not.

902
01:35:57,465 --> 01:36:00,384
- He won't go anywhere.
- Why do you say that?

903
01:36:00,510 --> 01:36:02,887
Calvera isn't worried
about food for winter.

904
01:36:03,095 --> 01:36:07,892
He's worried about the food his men
haven't eaten for the last three days.

905
01:36:08,851 --> 01:36:11,437
The price of corn is going up.

906
01:36:11,646 --> 01:36:14,982
- They're starving.
- How do you know?

907
01:36:15,107 --> 01:36:19,070
- Starving and broke.
- How do you know?

908
01:36:19,987 --> 01:36:21,989
Oh...

909
01:36:23,032 --> 01:36:25,117
I've been up there.

910
01:36:26,994 --> 01:36:29,580
Well, we'd better be ready for them.

911
01:36:29,789 --> 01:36:34,377
- Because they gotta die or win.
- Válgame Dios if they do win.

912
01:36:34,502 --> 01:36:37,922
- They won't win.
- Are you God, that you can say for sure?

913
01:36:38,047 --> 01:36:41,050
We're surrounded.
Outnumbered. What are we to do?

914
01:36:41,175 --> 01:36:43,553
Keep on fighting.

915
01:36:43,678 --> 01:36:45,972
Do you want to see us
killed off one by one?

916
01:36:46,055 --> 01:36:48,683
That is not what you were hired for.

917
01:36:49,183 --> 01:36:52,645
- Once you start, there's no stopping.
- You understood that, and I told him!

918
01:36:52,854 --> 01:36:54,397
I don't care.

919
01:36:54,522 --> 01:36:57,942
Go away. All of you.
Get on your horses and go.

920
01:36:58,067 --> 01:37:00,653
- Let Calvera have the food.
- Give him what he wants.

921
01:37:00,862 --> 01:37:04,115
- At least we'll be alive.
- Quiet! And listen to me!

922
01:37:04,198 --> 01:37:06,701
No! It is easy for them to say fight.

923
01:37:06,826 --> 01:37:10,246
They have no sons,
no daughters, no wives.

924
01:37:10,371 --> 01:37:12,748
Go. Now, before it's too late.

925
01:37:19,547 --> 01:37:21,841
Is that what you want?

926
01:37:22,466 --> 01:37:23,926
Answer me!

927
01:37:24,343 --> 01:37:29,223
Who's for going on and who's for
giving up? I want to know now.

928
01:37:35,271 --> 01:37:38,941
Don't be fools! You'll turn our village
into a graveyard.

929
01:37:39,025 --> 01:37:42,361
Tell them to go.
It's the only thing for them to do.

930
01:37:42,486 --> 01:37:44,655
I'll tell you what I can do.

931
01:37:44,780 --> 01:37:48,743
I can kill the first man who so much
as whispers a word about giving up.

932
01:37:48,826 --> 01:37:52,788
The very first man,
so help me, I'll blow his head off!

933
01:38:17,939 --> 01:38:22,193
We started this fight...
and we're gonna finish it!

934
01:38:22,401 --> 01:38:24,487
With or without you.

935
01:38:39,418 --> 01:38:41,504
I'm not sayin' we bit off
more than we can chew,...

936
01:38:41,587 --> 01:38:44,715
..but we oughta talk about
what we're gonna do.

937
01:38:44,841 --> 01:38:47,426
We start acting like
we had some good sense.

938
01:38:47,552 --> 01:38:51,389
We figured to raise the ante just enough
to make Calvera play someplace else.

939
01:38:51,514 --> 01:38:54,934
- We figured wrong.
- We're the only game in town.

940
01:38:55,059 --> 01:38:57,436
- A man can't call 'em all.
- I didn't say he could.

941
01:38:57,645 --> 01:39:01,941
All I'm saying is that sometimes
you bend with the breeze... or you break.

942
01:39:04,735 --> 01:39:06,404
D'you wanna go?

943
01:39:06,612 --> 01:39:12,034
There comes a time to get out. The village
will be no worse off than before we came.

944
01:39:12,159 --> 01:39:15,580
You forget one thing. We took a contract.

945
01:39:15,705 --> 01:39:19,667
- It's not the kind courts enforce.
- That's just the kind you've gotta keep.

946
01:39:19,876 --> 01:39:23,212
A noble thought,
but the way things are right now,...

947
01:39:25,298 --> 01:39:28,718
- ..l don't know.
- The odds are too high.

948
01:39:28,843 --> 01:39:30,803
- Much too high.
- Then we go?

949
01:39:30,928 --> 01:39:32,889
No.

950
01:39:34,557 --> 01:39:36,851
We lower the odds.

951
01:39:36,976 --> 01:39:39,353
Right up into the hills,...

952
01:39:39,478 --> 01:39:41,564
..past the men on guard,...

953
01:39:41,647 --> 01:39:43,733
..right into their camp.

954
01:39:46,360 --> 01:39:50,823
I sat there, I smoked a cigarette
with them, we discussed a few things.

955
01:39:53,117 --> 01:39:55,119
We... you know...

956
01:39:56,245 --> 01:39:59,373
All of a sudden,
there was Calvera himself.

957
01:40:01,375 --> 01:40:05,004
Right beside me.
When I brought back the news,...

958
01:40:05,129 --> 01:40:09,717
..you should have seen the look I got
from Britt - and from Chris.

959
01:40:09,926 --> 01:40:13,763
They have seen a thing or two
in their time, and done them too.

960
01:40:13,971 --> 01:40:17,850
They're not men
you can impress easily. Oh, no.

961
01:40:17,934 --> 01:40:22,230
But when they looked at me,
I knew I was one of them at last.

962
01:40:27,652 --> 01:40:29,529
Well,...

963
01:40:29,612 --> 01:40:32,323
..you'd better take a look at me, too.

964
01:40:32,448 --> 01:40:36,494
Am I the kind of man
who'd live in a place like this? Hm?

965
01:40:37,537 --> 01:40:40,039
Digging my life away out in the fields?

966
01:40:40,164 --> 01:40:42,458
Me, a farmer - a peasant?

967
01:40:44,752 --> 01:40:47,463
You know what I'm saying, huh?

968
01:40:47,547 --> 01:40:51,300
Wherever they go -
Chris, Vin, Britt, the others -

969
01:40:52,468 --> 01:40:54,762
I go with them.

970
01:40:56,097 --> 01:41:01,727
And if you think you, or anything you do,
could make me change my mind, forget it.

971
01:41:04,146 --> 01:41:06,440
I want you to understand that.

972
01:41:08,317 --> 01:41:11,028
I... want you to understand that...

973
01:41:14,240 --> 01:41:16,242
..this...

974
01:41:24,250 --> 01:41:26,752
..will get you nothing but this.

975
01:41:29,672 --> 01:41:32,592
We're going to hit Calvera,...

976
01:41:32,717 --> 01:41:35,845
..maybe drive off some of his horses.

977
01:41:35,928 --> 01:41:38,556
Then if he attacks, he'll be on foot.

978
01:41:38,639 --> 01:41:40,933
I'll go with you. I know every rock.

979
01:41:41,142 --> 01:41:43,561
No, you stay. You're in charge here.

980
01:41:43,769 --> 01:41:45,938
You can count on me.

981
01:41:47,732 --> 01:41:49,901
I know I can.

982
01:42:45,706 --> 01:42:49,752
- They've left to hit the village.
- No.

983
01:42:49,877 --> 01:42:52,255
We'd have heard shots.

984
01:42:54,882 --> 01:42:56,759
They've gone.

985
01:43:30,001 --> 01:43:32,211
Good evening.

986
01:43:54,525 --> 01:43:56,694
You'll be dead. All of you!

987
01:43:57,528 --> 01:43:58,988
Like that!

988
01:43:59,113 --> 01:44:01,490
If that's what you want.

989
01:44:01,699 --> 01:44:03,993
Do we have a choice?

990
01:44:06,829 --> 01:44:09,123
Of course.

991
01:44:09,207 --> 01:44:11,083
Sit down.

992
01:44:11,292 --> 01:44:13,294
Let's talk.

993
01:44:16,005 --> 01:44:19,008
Things are turned around now, uh?

994
01:44:19,133 --> 01:44:21,928
You're wondering how.

995
01:44:22,053 --> 01:44:25,264
Your friends, they don't like you
very much any more.

996
01:44:25,473 --> 01:44:28,100
You force them
to make too many decisions.

997
01:44:28,184 --> 01:44:30,686
With me... only one decision.

998
01:44:30,811 --> 01:44:32,897
Do what I say.

999
01:44:33,105 --> 01:44:35,274
You should not be surprised.

1000
01:44:35,399 --> 01:44:39,862
My good friend Sotero,
he arranged to let me come in.

1001
01:44:40,696 --> 01:44:42,698
Understand?

1002
01:44:45,910 --> 01:44:48,204
Well, anyway,...

1003
01:44:48,412 --> 01:44:50,915
..to business!

1004
01:44:51,040 --> 01:44:53,835
I could kill you all. You agree?

1005
01:45:05,304 --> 01:45:07,598
Well... you don't disagree.

1006
01:45:09,058 --> 01:45:13,771
- Anyway, I don't want to kill you.
- Why so generous?

1007
01:45:14,897 --> 01:45:18,025
Practical. They hear about it up north.

1008
01:45:18,150 --> 01:45:21,279
Maybe some friends of yours
make more trouble for me.

1009
01:45:21,362 --> 01:45:24,282
A man who never wants no trouble.

1010
01:45:25,533 --> 01:45:28,035
We have a saying here.

1011
01:45:28,160 --> 01:45:32,415
A thief who steals from a thief
is pardoned for 100 years.

1012
01:45:32,540 --> 01:45:36,586
All right, what does that leave?
Only one thing. I pardon you.

1013
01:45:38,171 --> 01:45:41,299
- Ride on.
- Just like that?

1014
01:45:41,507 --> 01:45:43,593
Mm, just like...

1015
01:45:43,801 --> 01:45:47,972
I'll make it easy for you. You want food?

1016
01:45:48,181 --> 01:45:49,724
Give them food.

1017
01:45:49,932 --> 01:45:52,351
Water? All right. Water.

1018
01:45:52,560 --> 01:45:55,479
Horses? Saddled and waiting.

1019
01:45:55,563 --> 01:45:57,648
Guns?

1020
01:45:59,233 --> 01:46:03,070
The guns... the gun belts,
you take off and put here now.

1021
01:46:09,452 --> 01:46:12,163
What about these people?

1022
01:46:12,246 --> 01:46:17,376
What happens to these people will
happen whether I kill you first or not.

1023
01:46:25,176 --> 01:46:27,386
Just a little gesture, huh?

1024
01:46:28,513 --> 01:46:32,183
To show these people
who the real boss is.

1025
01:46:32,266 --> 01:46:35,394
You go, then I give you the guns back.

1026
01:46:36,354 --> 01:46:39,148
I know you won't
use those guns against me.

1027
01:46:39,357 --> 01:46:42,693
Only a crazy man
makes the same mistake twice.

1028
01:47:10,555 --> 01:47:16,185
I don't understand why a man like you
took the job in the first place. Hm? Why?

1029
01:47:16,269 --> 01:47:20,773
- I wonder myself.
- No, come on. Come on, tell me why.

1030
01:47:20,982 --> 01:47:24,610
A fella I knew in El Paso took all
his clothes off and jumped on a cactus.

1031
01:47:24,819 --> 01:47:26,904
I asked him the same question: why?

1032
01:47:27,738 --> 01:47:29,198
And?

1033
01:47:29,323 --> 01:47:33,160
He said "It seemed to be
a good idea at the time."

1034
01:48:11,741 --> 01:48:13,743
Good!

1035
01:48:14,660 --> 01:48:16,329
Right.

1036
01:48:16,454 --> 01:48:20,708
Go get your clothes, your saddlebags.
Anything you want, take it.

1037
01:48:20,833 --> 01:48:23,419
Your friends in there
owe you at least that much.

1038
01:48:23,544 --> 01:48:27,173
Santos, pick up the carbines.
Cirillo, the guns.

1039
01:48:42,313 --> 01:48:45,525
You know, the first time
I took a job as a hired gun,...

1040
01:48:45,650 --> 01:48:49,487
..a fella told me
"Vin, you can't afford to care."

1041
01:48:50,238 --> 01:48:51,989
There's your problem.

1042
01:48:52,114 --> 01:48:55,034
One thing I don't need
is somebody telling me my problem.

1043
01:48:55,117 --> 01:48:57,620
Like I said before, that's your problem.

1044
01:48:57,745 --> 01:49:01,582
You got involved in this village
and the people in it.

1045
01:49:02,959 --> 01:49:06,504
Do you ever get tired
of hearing yourself talk?

1046
01:49:06,712 --> 01:49:10,758
The reason I understand
your problem so well...

1047
01:49:10,883 --> 01:49:14,011
..is that I walked into
the same trap myself.

1048
01:49:14,929 --> 01:49:16,514
Yeah.

1049
01:49:16,722 --> 01:49:20,059
The first day we got here,
I started thinking...

1050
01:49:20,142 --> 01:49:24,230
..maybe I could put my gun away
and settle down and get a little land,...

1051
01:49:24,438 --> 01:49:25,982
..raise some cattle.

1052
01:49:26,190 --> 01:49:30,778
The things that these people know
about me wouldn't work against me.

1053
01:49:30,987 --> 01:49:35,992
L, uh... just didn't want you to think
you were the only sucker in town.

1054
01:49:54,260 --> 01:49:56,846
- Can we go with you, Bernardo?
- No.

1055
01:49:56,971 --> 01:49:59,765
- You like us, don't you?
- I guess so.

1056
01:49:59,974 --> 01:50:03,644
- You're one of us, aren't you?
- Yeah, I'm one of us all right.

1057
01:50:03,728 --> 01:50:06,230
- Take us with you! Please?
- No!

1058
01:50:06,355 --> 01:50:10,610
We're ashamed to live here.
Our fathers are... cowards.

1059
01:50:15,740 --> 01:50:17,700
Don't ever say that again
about your fathers.

1060
01:50:18,034 --> 01:50:19,702
They are not cowards!

1061
01:50:22,413 --> 01:50:24,999
You think I am brave
because I carry a gun.

1062
01:50:25,124 --> 01:50:28,961
Your fathers are much braver
because they carry responsibility.

1063
01:50:29,086 --> 01:50:31,881
For you, your brothers,
your sisters and your mothers.

1064
01:50:32,006 --> 01:50:35,635
This responsibility
is like a big rock that weighs a ton.

1065
01:50:35,760 --> 01:50:40,014
It bends and it twists them until finally
it buries them under the ground.

1066
01:50:40,139 --> 01:50:44,393
Nobody says they have to do it. They do it
because they love you and they want to.

1067
01:50:46,270 --> 01:50:49,815
I have never had this kind of courage.

1068
01:50:50,983 --> 01:50:52,860
Running a farm,...

1069
01:50:53,069 --> 01:50:58,491
..working like a mule, with no guarantee
what will become of it - this is bravery.

1070
01:51:00,868 --> 01:51:03,704
That's why I never
even started anything like that.

1071
01:51:03,913 --> 01:51:05,873
That's why I never will.

1072
01:51:20,888 --> 01:51:24,016
You'll do much better
on the other side of the border.

1073
01:51:24,141 --> 01:51:27,353
There you can steal cattle, hold up trains.

1074
01:51:27,478 --> 01:51:31,440
All you have to face is a sheriff,
a marshal.

1075
01:51:31,524 --> 01:51:33,818
Once I rob a bank in Texas.

1076
01:51:33,943 --> 01:51:37,488
Your government got after me
with a whole army. A whole army!

1077
01:51:37,697 --> 01:51:41,117
One little bank. It's clear, the meaning?

1078
01:51:41,534 --> 01:51:44,662
In Texas, only Texans can rob banks!

1079
01:51:53,337 --> 01:51:54,672
¡Adiós!

1080
01:52:40,676 --> 01:52:42,553
¡Adiós!

1081
01:52:51,729 --> 01:52:54,649
I could have told you they'd sell us out.

1082
01:53:09,956 --> 01:53:12,041
Farmers...

1083
01:53:12,583 --> 01:53:13,835
Farmers!

1084
01:53:14,043 --> 01:53:16,754
No honour, no loyalty - nothin'.

1085
01:53:18,422 --> 01:53:23,427
All they care about is their precious crops
and the miserable dirt they dig in.

1086
01:53:26,013 --> 01:53:28,099
I hate 'em.

1087
01:53:29,475 --> 01:53:32,687
- I hate 'em all.
- Sure you hate them.

1088
01:53:34,772 --> 01:53:38,317
Because you come
from a village just like that one.

1089
01:53:38,442 --> 01:53:40,736
You yourself are a farmer.

1090
01:53:43,239 --> 01:53:45,324
Yes.

1091
01:53:45,741 --> 01:53:47,910
Yes, I'm one of them.

1092
01:53:49,370 --> 01:53:52,081
But who made us the way we are? Hm?

1093
01:53:52,832 --> 01:53:55,001
Men with guns.

1094
01:53:55,960 --> 01:53:58,880
Men like Calvera and...

1095
01:53:59,380 --> 01:54:01,591
..men like you.

1096
01:54:02,633 --> 01:54:05,136
And now me.

1097
01:54:08,472 --> 01:54:10,975
So what d'you expect us to be?

1098
01:54:17,940 --> 01:54:21,194
Nobody throws me my own guns
and says run. Nobody.

1099
01:54:22,320 --> 01:54:26,699
It took me a long, long time
to learn my elbow from a hot rock.

1100
01:54:27,742 --> 01:54:32,455
Right now, I belong back in that
border town, sleepin' on white sheets.

1101
01:54:35,583 --> 01:54:38,711
I think I'll ride back to that village.

1102
01:54:39,545 --> 01:54:44,634
You're crazy, all of ya! They won't lift
a finger to help. Think of the odds.

1103
01:54:46,010 --> 01:54:49,013
Harry... nobody's asking you to go back.

1104
01:54:50,056 --> 01:54:53,100
Ride on, Harry. It's all right.

1105
01:54:53,184 --> 01:54:55,895
Bet your sweet life, I will!

1106
01:55:02,068 --> 01:55:04,987
Come on, Lee.
They wanna get killed? Let 'em.

1107
01:55:05,196 --> 01:55:09,158
Go ahead, Lee.
You don't owe anything to anybody.

1108
01:55:10,826 --> 01:55:12,995
Except to myself.

1109
01:55:26,259 --> 01:55:28,427
You're crazy! All of ya!

1110
01:55:28,636 --> 01:55:30,930
Come on. Ya!

1111

1114
01:58:12,258 --> 01:58:14,343
Hold on, Chris, I'll get ya outta there!

1115
01:58:54,383 --> 01:58:56,886
- Chris...
- Yes, Harry?

1116
01:58:57,094 --> 01:58:59,055
I'd hate to die a sucker.

1117
01:58:59,180 --> 01:59:03,017
We didn't come here just to keep an eye
on a lotta corn and chilli peppers.

1118
01:59:03,226 --> 01:59:06,145
There was something else
all the time, wasn't there?

1119
01:59:06,270 --> 01:59:10,024
Yes, Harry.
You had it pegged right all along.

1120
01:59:10,107 --> 01:59:11,776
I knew it.

1121
01:59:11,984 --> 01:59:14,070
What was it?

1122
01:59:14,195 --> 01:59:16,072
Gold.

1123
01:59:16,280 --> 01:59:20,535
- Sacks of it.
- Oh... sounds beautiful!

1124
01:59:21,369 --> 01:59:24,914
- How much?
- At least a half a million.

1125
01:59:25,122 --> 01:59:29,001
- My cut woulda been what?
- About 70,000.

1126
01:59:30,127 --> 01:59:34,090
- I'll be damned!
<i>- (Kicking at door)</i>

1127
01:59:41,097 --> 01:59:44,308

1131
02:02:16,752 --> 02:02:19,172
You came back.

1132
02:02:19,380 --> 02:02:21,757
For a place like this.

1133
02:02:22,508 --> 02:02:24,468
Why?

1134
02:02:24,802 --> 02:02:26,679
A man like you?

1135
02:02:28,014 --> 02:02:30,016
Why?

1136
02:03:04,091 --> 02:03:08,262
- Bernardo! Bernardo!
- No. No, get back. Go on! Get back.

We didn't... We didn't mean to do it.

1139
02:03:22,360 --> 02:03:24,654
We didn't mean to do it.

1140
02:03:29,325 --> 02:03:31,619
You see?

1141
02:03:31,744 --> 02:03:34,956
I told you. You see your fathers?

<i>(gasps in pain)</i>

1143

What's my name?

1144
02:03:46,425 --> 02:03:49,554
- Bernardo.
- Bernardo!

1145
02:03:51,138 --> 02:03:53,516
You're damn right.

1146
02:04:43,274 --> 02:04:45,443
You could stay, you know.

1147
02:04:45,651 --> 02:04:48,571
They wouldn't be sorry to have you stay.

1148
02:04:49,197 --> 02:04:54,535
- They won't be sorry to see us go, either.
- Yes. The fighting is over.

1149
02:04:54,619 --> 02:04:56,704
Your work is done.

1150
02:04:56,829 --> 02:04:59,624
For them, each season has its tasks.

1151
02:05:01,209 --> 02:05:05,254
If there were a season for gratitude,
they'd show it more.

1152
02:05:06,422 --> 02:05:10,259
We didn't get any more
than we expected, old man.

1153
02:05:11,427 --> 02:05:13,721
Only the farmers have won.

1154
02:05:14,764 --> 02:05:17,141
They remain for ever.

1155
02:05:17,350 --> 02:05:20,061
They are like the land itself.

1156
02:05:21,312 --> 02:05:23,814
You helped to rid them of Calvera,...

1157
02:05:24,357 --> 02:05:27,985
..the way a strong wind
helps rid them of locusts.

1158
02:05:29,862 --> 02:05:32,073
You are like the wind,...

1159
02:05:32,365 --> 02:05:35,910
..blowing over the land and passing on.

1160
02:05:40,206 --> 02:05:42,500
God be with you.

1161
02:05:44,794 --> 02:05:47,296
Adiós.

1162
02:06:29,714 --> 02:06:31,716
Adiós.

1163
02:06:37,763 --> 02:06:39,015
Adiós.

1164
02:07:11,339 --> 02:07:13,841
The old man was right.

1165
02:07:13,925 --> 02:07:16,010
Only the farmers won.

1166
02:07:16,219 --> 02:07:18,221
We lost.

1167
02:07:18,930 --> 02:07:21,224
We always lose.
