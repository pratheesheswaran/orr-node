3
00:05:21,390 --> 00:05:25,400
What about the others?
I'd be playing a dirty trick on them.

4
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:30,110
- They'll be happy you're gone.
- They have a war to win.

5
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:34,400
Well... what the hell.

6
00:05:34,450 --> 00:05:38,920
If they don't want any more missions,
let them stand up and say so.

7
00:05:38,950 --> 00:05:41,840
- Precisely.
- Exactly.

8
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:36,000
Help! Help!

9
00:06:59,990 --> 00:07:02,210
Help him!

10
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:04,790
- What?
- Help him! Help him!

11
00:07:04,830 --> 00:07:07,950
- Help who?
- Help the bombardier!

12
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:12,750
- I'm the bombardier, l'm all right.
- Then help him! Help HlM!

13
00:07:26,350 --> 00:07:29,110
- Snowden.
- What'd he say?

14
00:07:29,140 --> 00:07:33,480
- He said, "Snowden".
- Snowden's dead.

15
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:37,150
Snowden?

16
00:07:37,190 --> 00:07:42,580
- Why's he talking to a dead man?
- He's Yossarian. He's crazy.

17
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:46,540
- Who says so?
- I do.

18
00:07:46,580 --> 00:07:48,910
- Cos l hate that son of a bitch?
- Who?

19
00:07:48,950 --> 00:07:51,460
- Colonel Cathcart.
- I didn't ask you.

20
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:54,340
- Cathcart isn't here.
- Who mentioned him?

21
00:07:54,380 --> 00:07:57,470
- Colonel Korn isn't here.
- Who mentioned him?

22
00:07:57,510 --> 00:08:00,390
- Who do you hate?
- What son of a bitch lS here?

23
00:08:00,420 --> 00:08:03,850
- You don't make sense.
- You got a persecution complex.

24
00:08:03,890 --> 00:08:05,940
- Damn right.
- You admit it!

25
00:08:05,970 --> 00:08:08,940
I admit l'm being persecuted,
by them!

26
00:08:08,970 --> 00:08:13,810
- Who specifically is "them"?
- All of them! Who do you think?

27
00:08:13,850 --> 00:08:16,830
- I've no idea!
- Then how do you know they aren't?

28
00:08:16,860 --> 00:08:18,200
Ahhh!

29
00:08:18,230 --> 00:08:21,360
- That's sheer what-do-you-call-it.
- Sophistry.

30
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:24,670
Like hell it is, McWatt.
They're trying to kill me!

31
00:08:24,700 --> 00:08:27,740
No one's trying to kill you.
Eat your dessert.

32
00:08:27,790 --> 00:08:32,050
- Then why are they shooting at me?
- They're shooting at everyone.

33
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:36,970
- What difference does that make?
- Suppose everyone thought like you?

34
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:41,890
- I'd be a fool to think different.
- You need your head examined.

35
00:08:41,920 --> 00:08:45,220
There's nothing wrong with it.

36
00:08:45,260 --> 00:08:49,140
- Look at it once, will you?
- Yossarian, your head is OK.

37
00:08:49,180 --> 00:08:52,470
Please, don't do that.

38
00:08:55,100 --> 00:08:57,990
- Yes. What?
- Doc? Doc?

39
00:08:58,020 --> 00:09:01,570
- I want you to ground me.
- Don't start that again.

40
00:09:08,660 --> 00:09:11,550
- Doc, l don't want to fly any more.
- Why?

41
00:09:11,580 --> 00:09:13,630
It's dangerous.

42
00:09:13,660 --> 00:09:17,930
Listen, l told you...
Let's get out of here, huh?

43
00:09:19,130 --> 00:09:23,710
I've flown 35 missions.
Now that nut has raised it to 50.

44
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:27,940
In any other outfit l would've been
rotated after 25. Help me out.

45
00:09:27,970 --> 00:09:30,860
I'm due for rotation myself soon

46
00:09:30,890 --> 00:09:34,070
if l don't cause trouble
or break any rules.

47
00:09:34,100 --> 00:09:38,200
One rule says l can't ground anyone
just because he asks me to.

48
00:09:38,230 --> 00:09:42,870
- Can you ground someone who's crazy?
- Of course. A rule says l have to.

49
00:09:42,900 --> 00:09:46,000
- L'm crazy!
- Who says so?

50
00:09:46,030 --> 00:09:49,320
Ask Nately, Dobbs, McWatt...
Hey, Orr, tell him!

51
00:09:49,370 --> 00:09:51,530
- Tell him what?
- Am l crazy?

52
00:09:51,580 --> 00:09:54,210
He's crazy, Doc.
He won't fly with me.

53
00:09:54,250 --> 00:09:58,300
I'd take good care of him
but he won't. He's crazy, all right.

54
00:09:58,330 --> 00:10:01,760
- See that? They all say l'm crazy.
- They're crazy.

55
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:04,720
- Why don't you ground them?
- Why don't they ask me?

56
00:10:04,760 --> 00:10:08,050
- Because they're crazy!
- Of course they're crazy.

57
00:10:08,090 --> 00:10:13,100
You can't let crazy people decide
whether you're crazy or not, can you?

58
00:10:15,180 --> 00:10:17,600
- Ls Orr crazy?
- Of course he is.

59
00:10:17,650 --> 00:10:21,610
He has to be if he keeps flying
after all those close calls.

60
00:10:21,650 --> 00:10:24,620
- Then why don't you ground him?
- He has to ask me.

61
00:10:24,650 --> 00:10:27,120
- That's all he's gotta do?
- That's all.

62
00:10:27,150 --> 00:10:31,080
- Then you can ground him?
- No. Then l cannot ground him.

63
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:32,780
There's a catch.

64
00:10:32,830 --> 00:10:34,880
- A catch?
- Sure, Catch-22.

65
00:10:34,910 --> 00:10:38,710
Anyone who wants to get out of combat
isn't really crazy,

66
00:10:38,750 --> 00:10:40,830
so l can't ground him.

67
00:10:42,380 --> 00:10:44,960
OK. Let me see
if l got this straight.

68
00:10:45,010 --> 00:10:48,050
In order to be grounded,
l've got to be crazy

69
00:10:48,090 --> 00:10:50,430
and l must be crazy to keep flying.

70
00:10:50,470 --> 00:10:53,900
But if l ask to be grounded,
l'm not crazy any more

71
00:10:53,930 --> 00:10:57,280
- and l have to keep flying.
- You've got it! That's Catch-22.

72
00:10:57,310 --> 00:10:59,390
Whoooo!

73
00:11:04,110 --> 00:11:08,610
- That's some catch, that Catch-22.
- It's the best there is!

74
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:16,240
Good afternoon, this is Major Danby,
your Flight Operations Officer,

75
00:11:16,290 --> 00:11:18,700
welcoming you to today's mission.

76
00:11:18,750 --> 00:11:23,330
You've all been briefed on this
morning's run, so l won't go over it.

77
00:11:23,380 --> 00:11:27,960
There's no sense naming names
since the enemy is probably listening

78
00:11:28,010 --> 00:11:30,310
and there's no reason l can think of

79
00:11:30,340 --> 00:11:32,980
to tell him
where we're going to strike.

80
00:11:33,010 --> 00:11:36,780
That's the stupidest goddamn thing
l ever heard him say.

81
00:11:36,810 --> 00:11:38,070
That's right!

82
00:11:38,100 --> 00:11:41,980
Weather conditions
have improved tremendously,

83
00:11:42,020 --> 00:11:45,400
so you won't have any trouble
seeing the target.

84
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:47,520
Of course, you mustn't forget,

85
00:11:47,570 --> 00:11:51,530
that means that they will have
no trouble at all seeing you.

86
00:11:51,570 --> 00:11:55,910
Colonel Cathcart would like to say
a few words before takeoff.

87
00:11:55,950 --> 00:11:59,550
- And so, without further ado...
- Give me that!

88
00:11:59,580 --> 00:12:03,800
Men, l'm not gonna waste
any more of your time than l have to.

89
00:12:03,830 --> 00:12:07,010
I wanna wish you good luck
on today's mission.

90
00:12:07,050 --> 00:12:09,890
To those of you
who won't be coming back,

91
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:14,510
we're gonna do our best to take care
of your wives and/or sweethearts.

92
00:12:14,550 --> 00:12:16,440
And don't forget,

93
00:12:16,470 --> 00:12:20,530
General Dreedle wants to see
a nice, tight bombing pattern

94
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:22,980
on those aerial photographs.

95
00:12:23,020 --> 00:12:25,100
Everyone ready to go?

96
00:14:38,490 --> 00:14:42,030
- Colonel Korn, stay in the tower.
- Sir?

97
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:46,720
Stay on top of this. l'd like to know
when my boys make target.

98
00:14:46,750 --> 00:14:48,660
Yes, sir!

99
00:14:48,710 --> 00:14:51,890
What is it, Lieutenant Minderbinder?

100
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:56,310
- An egg, sir.
- L know that, Lieutenant.

101
00:14:56,340 --> 00:15:00,270
- A fresh egg, sir.
- Where did you get the egg?

102
00:15:00,300 --> 00:15:06,010
In Malta, sir, where there are
enough chickens to lay fresh eggs

103
00:15:06,060 --> 00:15:08,480
for every officer in the squadron,

104
00:15:08,520 --> 00:15:12,660
at five cents apiece
from the mess fund.

105
00:15:12,690 --> 00:15:17,580
- Yes?
- With a profit of two cents per egg.

106
00:15:17,610 --> 00:15:19,580
For whom?

107
00:15:19,610 --> 00:15:25,410
Sir, for whomever sells the eggs
to the mess.

108
00:15:25,450 --> 00:15:29,760
- And who may that be, Milo?
- Ah, sir.

109
00:15:29,790 --> 00:15:33,140
- Oranges from Marrakech, pecans...
- Pecans?

110
00:15:33,170 --> 00:15:37,670
And in Palermo, 10,000 gallons
of the finest ltalian olive oil.

111
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:41,310
The Sicilians need blankets.
It would be a fair trade.

112
00:15:41,340 --> 00:15:43,730
They're interested in Sardinia.

113
00:15:43,760 --> 00:15:48,270
All we need is the cooperation
of the countries we're dealing with.

114
00:15:48,310 --> 00:15:49,900
What countries?

115
00:15:49,940 --> 00:15:54,520
The African nations, countries
in the Greater Mediterranean area.

116
00:15:54,570 --> 00:15:58,500
So what we need is an additional
assignment of personnel,

117
00:15:58,530 --> 00:16:01,370
a little time and a plane.

118
00:16:01,410 --> 00:16:04,500
- What plane?
- One of ours, sir. lf l had one,

119
00:16:04,530 --> 00:16:08,080
l could get the gasoline to Malta
and bring the eggs back.

120
00:16:08,120 --> 00:16:09,790
All right.

121
00:16:09,830 --> 00:16:14,720
And if l was taken off combat duty
until l get this into operation...

122
00:16:14,750 --> 00:16:16,010
But Milo...

123
00:16:16,050 --> 00:16:19,090
l know, sir,
l'm just an acting mess officer

124
00:16:19,130 --> 00:16:23,310
but it requires my full attention.
It's to everyone's benefit.

125
00:16:23,340 --> 00:16:26,110
- Take whatever you need.
- Thank you.

126
00:16:26,140 --> 00:16:30,150
I hope to give the men the finest
cuisine in the entire world.

127
00:16:30,180 --> 00:16:31,650
Uh-huh...

128
00:16:31,690 --> 00:16:36,270
- lsn't that something to shoot at?
- Yes, Milo, it certainly is.

129
00:16:44,660 --> 00:16:49,380
With your permission, l'd like to
show you something l've had printed.

130
00:16:49,410 --> 00:16:52,620
- What is it?
- Just an idea, sir. lt's a share.

131
00:16:52,670 --> 00:16:55,390
- A share?
- Ln M&M Enterprises.

132
00:16:55,420 --> 00:17:00,170
If we get my ideas into practice,
it should be organised like a mart.

133
00:17:00,210 --> 00:17:02,800
- A mart?
- Yes, sir, a syndicate.

134
00:17:02,840 --> 00:17:06,720
An enterprise. There are tremendous
profits to be made, Colonel.

135
00:17:06,760 --> 00:17:08,820
- For us?
- For everyone.

136
00:17:08,850 --> 00:17:14,020
What will be good for M&M Enterprises
will be good for the country.

137
00:17:14,060 --> 00:17:18,450
- You'll have our full cooperation.
- Thank you, sir.

138
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:23,490
If l take a plane this afternoon,
l'll get this material to Alexandria.

139
00:17:23,530 --> 00:17:26,620
- There's a huge cotton crop.
- Cotton?

140
00:17:26,660 --> 00:17:29,780
- Cotton is a very liquid commodity.
- How much?

141
00:17:29,830 --> 00:17:33,290
- We'll trade for it, sir.
- With what?

142
00:17:33,330 --> 00:17:35,720
Silk! 4,000 yards of silk.

143
00:17:36,790 --> 00:17:40,140
How in the world
did you get hold of so much silk?

144
00:17:40,170 --> 00:17:42,470
Where the hell's my parachute?

145
00:17:44,840 --> 00:17:49,310
OK, all right, which one of you
bastards stole my parachute?

146
00:17:56,270 --> 00:18:01,440
Hello, hello, this is the bombardier
here. We gotta turn back.

147
00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:04,750
Uh, Nately, we gotta turn back now.

148
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:08,580
Nately! Do you hear me up there?

149
00:18:08,620 --> 00:18:12,130
We gotta turn back.
OK, we're gonna turn back now.

150
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:16,300
Nately, let's turn back.
We're gonna turn back!

151
00:18:16,330 --> 00:18:19,430
What is it this time, Yossarian?

152
00:18:19,460 --> 00:18:23,000
Some bastard stole my chute! Aahh!

153
00:18:23,050 --> 00:18:27,310
- Anything the matter?
- My parachute. lt's gone!

154
00:18:27,340 --> 00:18:30,230
- Don't worry about it.
- What do you mean?

155
00:18:30,260 --> 00:18:34,110
What do l do if l have to bail out,
use my handkerchief?!

156
00:18:34,140 --> 00:18:38,810
That kind of humour in the face
of adversity keeps America strong.

157
00:18:38,850 --> 00:18:40,490
I like you, Yossarian.

158
00:18:40,520 --> 00:18:43,730
Aardvark, l'd like to kill you
but l haven't got time.

159
00:18:43,780 --> 00:18:46,960
You could have my chute
but l gave it to Milo.

160
00:18:46,990 --> 00:18:50,110
- You gave it to Milo?
- He's got all the chutes.

161
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:53,840
He's got a hell of a deal going
for silk in Alexandria.

162
00:18:53,870 --> 00:18:56,260
Maybe l do have time to kill...

163
00:18:56,290 --> 00:19:00,140
- Looks like they've seen us coming.
- They've seen us!

164
00:19:00,170 --> 00:19:05,170
- Oh, God, they've seen us!
- Get ready to dump those eggs.

165
00:19:09,340 --> 00:19:13,650
They're shooting at me! Where are we?

166
00:19:14,970 --> 00:19:17,610
Aardvark, where are we?

167
00:19:24,070 --> 00:19:27,780
- L think we're there.
- 'We're there?'

168
00:19:29,240 --> 00:19:32,450
We're there? We're there!

169
00:19:34,120 --> 00:19:36,040
Get ready to turn!

170
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:39,130
Four, three...

171
00:19:39,170 --> 00:19:44,330
two, one, drop! Let's go!

172
00:19:44,380 --> 00:19:48,310
Turn right hard! Turn, turn!

173
00:19:48,340 --> 00:19:52,270
Turn, you son of a bitch! Turn right!

174
00:19:52,300 --> 00:19:56,150
- Turn, turn right!
- Look at that, will you?

175
00:19:56,180 --> 00:19:59,110
I think we've got 'em this time,
where it hurts.

176
00:19:59,140 --> 00:20:01,140
- Get out.
- L can't hear you.

177
00:20:01,190 --> 00:20:03,770
- Get back in the ship!
- What's that?

178
00:20:03,810 --> 00:20:08,230
Oh, climb, you bastard! Climb! Climb!

179
00:20:09,700 --> 00:20:14,450
- Fire! Fire on board!
- Fire? Where's the fire?

180
00:20:14,490 --> 00:20:18,250
- Get out of the nose!
- 'l'm not in the nose.'

181
00:20:18,290 --> 00:20:20,450
Speak up. l still can't hear you.

182
00:20:20,500 --> 00:20:23,260
They're trying to kill us.
Get out of here!

183
00:20:23,290 --> 00:20:27,880
- 'Which way should l go?'
- Turn left, you son of a bitch!

184
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:32,600
Look, there goes Orr.

185
00:20:35,350 --> 00:20:39,140
That stupid little bastard. Pull out!

186
00:20:47,610 --> 00:20:51,710
Hey, l think you've caught
a little something there.

187
00:20:51,740 --> 00:20:53,900
Is it my leg?

188
00:20:54,990 --> 00:20:56,880
Hey, is that my leg?

189
00:20:59,250 --> 00:21:02,510
- What's with my leg?
- Take it easy.

190
00:21:02,540 --> 00:21:04,620
My leg!

191
00:21:09,130 --> 00:21:11,770
Yossarian's caught one.

192
00:21:12,840 --> 00:21:15,010
- What's that?
- 'Help him!'

193
00:21:17,050 --> 00:21:19,610
- What?
- 'Help him! Help him!'

194
00:21:19,640 --> 00:21:22,740
- Help who?
- 'Help the bombardier!'

195
00:21:22,770 --> 00:21:27,270
- l'm the bombardier, l'm all right.
- 'Then help him! Help HlM!'

196
00:22:06,690 --> 00:22:09,370
lt's, uh...

197
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:13,110
- What's his name, the new gunner?
- 'Snowden.'

198
00:22:13,150 --> 00:22:15,240
Yeah.

199
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:20,280
Snowden.

200
00:22:58,490 --> 00:23:02,830
- L'm cold.
- OK. You're gonna be OK.

201
00:23:02,870 --> 00:23:06,500
I'm cold. l'm cold.

202
00:23:19,340 --> 00:23:22,800
Over here! Hurry up!

203
00:23:23,890 --> 00:23:26,110
Hey!

204
00:24:34,540 --> 00:24:38,250
- What?
- L asked how you were feeling.

205
00:24:44,470 --> 00:24:46,520
Oh.

206
00:24:47,770 --> 00:24:50,440
Better, thank you.

207
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:52,700
What about you?

208
00:24:54,520 --> 00:24:58,070
Me? Fairly well, thank you.

209
00:24:58,110 --> 00:25:00,440
You're welcome.

210
00:25:01,530 --> 00:25:05,540
- Except for a slight head cold.
- Mmm.

211
00:25:06,620 --> 00:25:10,130
Had it for about a week,
can't seem to shake it.

212
00:25:10,160 --> 00:25:12,660
Well, you know what they're like.

213
00:25:12,710 --> 00:25:16,470
No, l, uh... l don't.

214
00:25:17,630 --> 00:25:21,510
L've never really had a head cold.
L've tried but...

215
00:25:24,890 --> 00:25:27,390
Can't seem to be able to get one.

216
00:25:27,430 --> 00:25:30,150
Well, you're very lucky.

217
00:25:32,020 --> 00:25:35,060
Yes, l suppose l am.

218
00:25:36,560 --> 00:25:40,330
Except for this piece of shrapnel
l caught in my leg.

219
00:25:41,530 --> 00:25:43,610
Yes.

220
00:25:46,530 --> 00:25:51,000
L've never caught
a piece of shrapnel.

221
00:25:51,040 --> 00:25:53,420
Mmm.

222
00:26:04,510 --> 00:26:06,980
You're a chaplain!

223
00:26:07,010 --> 00:26:09,860
Yes. Didn't you know that?

224
00:26:09,890 --> 00:26:15,240
No, l didn't. l've never
really seen a chaplain before.

225
00:26:15,270 --> 00:26:19,230
I had no idea chaplains
looked like that.

226
00:26:19,270 --> 00:26:20,910
Well...

227
00:26:20,940 --> 00:26:25,530
Well, if l can do anything
to help you, anything at all, you...

228
00:26:25,570 --> 00:26:27,960
Anything?

229
00:26:29,030 --> 00:26:32,410
Like books, or-or... cigarettes.

230
00:26:33,500 --> 00:26:35,160
Toys?

231
00:26:35,210 --> 00:26:38,720
No, l have everything l need,
thank you very much.

232
00:26:39,790 --> 00:26:42,290
Ah...

233
00:26:42,340 --> 00:26:45,020
- You could do one thing for me.
- What?

234
00:26:45,050 --> 00:26:49,100
- You could speak to Major Duluth.
- The Squadron Commander?

235
00:26:49,140 --> 00:26:51,110
I don't want to fly any more.

236
00:26:51,140 --> 00:26:55,610
Cathcart raised the number of
missions! He's trying to kill us all!

237
00:26:55,640 --> 00:26:59,350
- L can't do it, l'm desperate!
- Lt's not my business...

238
00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:03,330
- l'm desperate!
- L'll see what l can do.

239
00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:06,570
I really will,
l'll... l'm gonna do my best.

240
00:27:22,590 --> 00:27:26,100
It takes me 45 minutes
to do this thing.

241
00:27:26,130 --> 00:27:28,550
First l sauté the chicken parts,

242
00:27:28,590 --> 00:27:31,350
then l put the raisins
and the onions in.

243
00:27:31,390 --> 00:27:34,980
Three packets of garlic,
don't forget the garlic.

244
00:27:55,240 --> 00:27:57,330
He-he yelled.

245
00:27:59,080 --> 00:28:02,510
L'm... l'm awfully sorry, sir.

246
00:28:02,540 --> 00:28:05,560
- What's your name?
- Major, sir.

247
00:28:05,590 --> 00:28:08,430
Not your rank, l asked your name.

248
00:28:08,470 --> 00:28:13,690
No, sir. l'm a captain.
My name is Major. Captain Major.

249
00:28:13,720 --> 00:28:16,220
Just about as clear as mud, isn't it?

250
00:28:16,270 --> 00:28:18,940
That's what it's just about
as clear as.

251
00:28:18,980 --> 00:28:23,980
Listen, Captain. You know
Major Duluth, the Squadron Commander?

252
00:28:24,020 --> 00:28:26,360
- He's a fine man, sir.
- Was.

253
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:29,250
- Sir?
- Major Duluth is dead.

254
00:28:29,280 --> 00:28:31,580
I'm distraught to hear that, sir.

255
00:28:31,610 --> 00:28:36,920
You may be distraught but he's dead.
Shot down over Perugia today.

256
00:28:36,950 --> 00:28:42,340
That'll teach him to go on missions
when he should be in the office.

257
00:28:42,380 --> 00:28:46,050
- L don't see...
- We need a new Squadron Commander.

258
00:28:46,090 --> 00:28:50,310
And you're the only major available
on our headquarters staff.

259
00:28:50,340 --> 00:28:52,640
No, Major is my name, not my rank.

260
00:28:52,680 --> 00:28:56,640
That's close enough for me, Major.
Consider yourself a major.

261
00:28:56,680 --> 00:28:59,970
I don't know anything
about being a commander.

262
00:29:00,020 --> 00:29:02,780
We all have to make sacrifices,
Major.

263
00:29:02,810 --> 00:29:05,230
Sir, l'm in Billeting and Laundry!

264
00:29:05,270 --> 00:29:09,410
I know that, sir, but we all
have to do our part, l guess.

265
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:12,250
Well, l don't like my part.

266
00:29:20,500 --> 00:29:24,590
Sergeant, l'm going to take
the rest of the afternoon off

267
00:29:24,630 --> 00:29:29,550
and lie down in my tent
and think about things.

268
00:29:29,590 --> 00:29:32,850
Sir, there's someone
waiting to see you.

269
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:35,270
- Now?
- Yes, sir.

270
00:29:36,550 --> 00:29:40,400
- Who is it?
- Captain Tappman, Group Chaplain.

271
00:29:40,430 --> 00:29:41,990
What does he want?

272
00:29:42,020 --> 00:29:46,110
I don't know, sir, something to do
with Captain Yossarian.

273
00:29:48,860 --> 00:29:51,620
Look, um, Sergeant...

274
00:29:53,240 --> 00:29:55,320
My job is tough enough

275
00:29:55,360 --> 00:30:00,000
without having to deal all the time
with people who want something.

276
00:30:00,040 --> 00:30:02,510
- Do l make myself clear?
- Yes, sir.

277
00:30:02,540 --> 00:30:04,840
I suppose
you're wondering about this.

278
00:30:04,870 --> 00:30:07,590
Sir, it's not my place to wonder.

279
00:30:07,630 --> 00:30:11,220
- Did you know people stare at me?
- No, sir.

280
00:30:11,260 --> 00:30:13,840
They think, "Who is that Major Major,

281
00:30:13,880 --> 00:30:17,840
"that he gets to be commander
without ever having flown?"

282
00:30:17,890 --> 00:30:21,760
- l don't think people think that.
- Well, they do.

283
00:30:21,810 --> 00:30:25,150
When l have this on,
they don't know who l am.

284
00:30:26,230 --> 00:30:29,030
Did... Did you know
in the Middle Ages

285
00:30:29,070 --> 00:30:33,570
princes and kings put on disguises
and walked around their subjects?

286
00:30:33,610 --> 00:30:37,540
- L didn't know that.
- You don't know everything, do you?

287
00:30:37,570 --> 00:30:42,130
- No, sir. Why did they do that?
- Why did who do what?!

288
00:30:42,160 --> 00:30:45,050
Why did they walk around in disguise?

289
00:30:45,080 --> 00:30:50,000
How the hell am l supposed to know?
I'm not some historian or anything.

290
00:30:50,040 --> 00:30:55,180
I'm just a guy trying to do his job.
Good afternoon, Sergeant.

291
00:30:56,260 --> 00:30:58,010
Sir?

292
00:30:58,050 --> 00:31:01,150
- What is it now?
- What do l do with the Chaplain?

293
00:31:01,180 --> 00:31:05,650
I don't want anyone to come
and see me while l'm in my office.

294
00:31:05,680 --> 00:31:08,530
What do l say to people
who want to see you?

295
00:31:08,560 --> 00:31:10,980
- Ask them to wait.
- For how long?

296
00:31:11,020 --> 00:31:12,490
Until l've left.

297
00:31:12,530 --> 00:31:14,410
- Then what?
- L don't care.

298
00:31:14,440 --> 00:31:17,210
- L send them in after you've left?
- Yes.

299
00:31:17,240 --> 00:31:19,570
- You won't be here then.
- No.

300
00:31:19,620 --> 00:31:22,740
Also, l don't want you coming in
while l'm here

301
00:31:22,790 --> 00:31:25,340
asking if there's anything
you can do.

302
00:31:25,370 --> 00:31:28,300
When should l ask
if there's anything l can do?

303
00:31:28,330 --> 00:31:30,250
When l'm not there!

304
00:31:30,290 --> 00:31:33,470
- What do l do then?
- Whatever has to be done.

305
00:31:33,500 --> 00:31:38,340
I'm sorry to have to talk
to you this way, but l have to.

306
00:31:38,380 --> 00:31:40,880
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye, sir.

307
00:31:46,850 --> 00:31:49,320
- Sergeant?
- Yes, sir?

308
00:31:49,350 --> 00:31:53,060
- Thank you, for everything.
- Thank you, sir.

309
00:31:58,450 --> 00:32:00,610
Major will see you now, Father.

310
00:32:00,660 --> 00:32:02,740
Thank you.

311
00:32:02,780 --> 00:32:07,170
- You don't have to call me Father.
- Sergeant Towser speaking.

312
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:09,200
Will you go in?

313
00:32:09,250 --> 00:32:12,510
Yes, sir. l have it here, sir.

314
00:32:19,590 --> 00:32:21,640
There's no one here.

315
00:32:21,680 --> 00:32:24,260
- Where?
- Ln Major Major's office.

316
00:32:24,310 --> 00:32:28,360
- When?
- When you go to see him.

317
00:32:28,390 --> 00:32:32,450
What l mean is you can't see him
when he's there,

318
00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:36,440
when he's in his office,
l've tried several times.

319
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:39,330
- When can you see him? Ever?
- Yes, yes.

320
00:32:39,360 --> 00:32:43,160
Yes, indeed, you can see him
when he isn't there.

321
00:32:44,280 --> 00:32:46,670
That is, he'll see you, all right,

322
00:32:46,700 --> 00:32:50,410
but only in his office
and only when he's not there.

323
00:32:50,460 --> 00:32:53,500
The other times, when he's in...

324
00:32:54,590 --> 00:32:58,300
he's not... there...

325
00:32:58,340 --> 00:33:00,390
to be seen.

326
00:33:00,420 --> 00:33:02,260
Except when he's out.

327
00:33:02,300 --> 00:33:04,850
What the hell
are you talking about, Father?

328
00:33:05,930 --> 00:33:08,970
- Sir?
- Get your ass in here, Padre.

329
00:33:11,480 --> 00:33:14,740
Are you describing
some mystical experience?

330
00:33:14,770 --> 00:33:17,360
Some peculiar things are happening.

331
00:33:17,400 --> 00:33:20,750
- You haven't had ecstatic visions?
- No, sir.

332
00:33:20,780 --> 00:33:23,990
Didn't see a burning bush,
hear any voices?

333
00:33:24,030 --> 00:33:27,240
- Nothing quite so extraordinary.
- L hope not.

334
00:33:27,280 --> 00:33:31,250
We have to keep our supernatural
episodes down to a minimum,

335
00:33:31,290 --> 00:33:35,220
- with a war to win and all that.
- Absolutely, sir.

336
00:33:35,250 --> 00:33:38,880
- May l ask where we're going?
- Where WE'RE going?

337
00:33:38,920 --> 00:33:41,930
You are going
to Colonel Cathcart's office.

338
00:33:41,970 --> 00:33:46,020
- Now?
- That's the general idea, Padre.

339
00:33:46,050 --> 00:33:49,820
Uh, i-is there anything wrong?
Have l done anything?

340
00:33:49,850 --> 00:33:54,110
I don't know. Are you and
Captain Yossarian up to something?

341
00:33:54,150 --> 00:33:57,160
- L don't know what you mean.
- Then who does?

342
00:33:57,190 --> 00:34:01,530
- L don't know, sir.
- You don't know much about anything.

343
00:34:01,570 --> 00:34:05,080
- No, sir. Sir?
- What is it?

344
00:34:05,110 --> 00:34:09,500
It's not necessary to call me Father.
I'm an Anabaptist.

345
00:34:09,540 --> 00:34:12,830
Well, thanks for
setting me straight on that.

346
00:34:12,870 --> 00:34:16,830
- L thought you'd like to know.
- You're a captain, right?

347
00:34:16,880 --> 00:34:20,720
- L'm a lieutenant colonel. Correct?
- Yes, sir, it is.

348
00:34:20,760 --> 00:34:25,840
Then l can call you anything l want,
unless you have some objections.

349
00:34:25,890 --> 00:34:28,190
- Out!
- Thank you, sir.

350
00:34:30,220 --> 00:34:33,030
Uh, sir, do you think now...?

351
00:34:34,100 --> 00:34:38,600
- Morning. Anything l can get you?
- Morning, Lieutenant. What?

352
00:34:38,650 --> 00:34:41,150
- Do you need any supplies?
- No.

353
00:34:41,190 --> 00:34:44,400
Whiskey, silk stockings, fresh fruit?

354
00:34:44,450 --> 00:34:48,950
The Colonel loves fresh fruit.
What about religious supplies?

355
00:34:48,990 --> 00:34:52,840
I can get hold of an entire
shipment of religious relics,

356
00:34:52,870 --> 00:34:54,950
blessed by the Pope himself.

357
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:58,510
Includes the wrist and collar bones
of some of your top saints.

358
00:34:58,540 --> 00:35:03,430
- That's very kind of you.
- Lf you need anything, ask for Milo.

359
00:35:03,460 --> 00:35:07,730
- L've never been issued a blanket.
- Anything at all, now!

360
00:35:21,570 --> 00:35:24,040
Yeah?

361
00:35:24,070 --> 00:35:27,330
I think the Colonel wants to see me.

362
00:35:27,360 --> 00:35:30,290
- He does?
- L believe so. l'm...

363
00:35:31,160 --> 00:35:34,280
- Chaplain Tappman.
- You're Chaplain Tappman?

364
00:35:34,330 --> 00:35:38,260
Have a seat. l'll tell the Colonel
you're here, Father.

365
00:35:38,290 --> 00:35:40,370
It's not...

366
00:35:52,560 --> 00:35:54,940
You'd better get some dry things.

367
00:35:56,020 --> 00:35:59,700
Oh, l will, as soon as the Colonel
is through with me.

368
00:36:02,690 --> 00:36:06,070
- They just got me out of the sea.
- They did?

369
00:36:06,110 --> 00:36:10,830
- L drifted for almost three days.
- You should report to the hospital.

370
00:36:10,870 --> 00:36:14,410
- You could catch pneumonia.
- Oh, no, not me.

371
00:36:14,450 --> 00:36:17,630
- This is my fourth time.
- How do you mean?

372
00:36:17,660 --> 00:36:21,460
L've put down in the Mediterranean
once, once in the Adriatic,

373
00:36:21,500 --> 00:36:25,210
then l crash-landed one plane
and l bailed out once.

374
00:36:26,510 --> 00:36:29,850
- You're very lucky.
- That's what some folks say.

375
00:36:29,880 --> 00:36:34,300
Yossarian says they're gonna start
taking it out of my salary.

376
00:36:34,350 --> 00:36:35,860
Yossarian?

377
00:36:35,890 --> 00:36:39,940
- He's a friend. Do you know him?
- Yes, as a matter of fact...

378
00:36:39,980 --> 00:36:42,910
- Captain Tappman!
- Yes?

379
00:36:44,770 --> 00:36:48,950
- Perhaps you shouldn't fly any more.
- Lt's good practice.

380
00:36:49,990 --> 00:36:54,380
- Tappman, the Colonel is a busy man.
- Yes, of course.

381
00:37:02,080 --> 00:37:06,420
Well, Chaplain, we don't see
much of you around here lately.

382
00:37:06,460 --> 00:37:11,020
Well, sir, l try to stay
out of the way as much as possible.

383
00:37:11,050 --> 00:37:15,270
- L make the men uncomfortable.
- Nonsense!

384
00:37:15,300 --> 00:37:19,970
I can't imagine any man not enjoying
the benefits of your presence.

385
00:37:20,020 --> 00:37:23,390
Unless, of course, they're atheists.

386
00:37:23,440 --> 00:37:27,150
- Not much chance of that, though.
- L don't know, sir.

387
00:37:27,190 --> 00:37:29,870
- Lsn't atheism against the law?
- No.

388
00:37:29,900 --> 00:37:33,780
It isn't?
Then it's un-American, isn't it?

389
00:37:33,820 --> 00:37:36,540
- L'm not sure.
- Well, l am.

390
00:37:36,580 --> 00:37:38,960
If l find any atheists on this base,

391
00:37:38,990 --> 00:37:42,710
you can bet they'll soon
start believing in something.

392
00:37:42,750 --> 00:37:46,010
That's not why
l called you in, Chaplain.

393
00:37:46,040 --> 00:37:48,970
I want you to take a look at this.

394
00:37:50,300 --> 00:37:52,520
Page 48.

395
00:37:55,470 --> 00:38:00,390
Don't read the whole thing. You can
get the point from the photographs.

396
00:38:00,430 --> 00:38:03,640
There's a full-page picture
of a colonel in England

397
00:38:03,690 --> 00:38:07,280
whose chaplain conducts prayers
before every mission.

398
00:38:07,310 --> 00:38:10,330
I see no reason why
the Saturday Evening Post

399
00:38:10,360 --> 00:38:13,790
should not be interested
in the story of my outfit.

400
00:38:13,820 --> 00:38:19,130
Think up some nice, snappy prayers
to send the men out feeling good.

401
00:38:19,160 --> 00:38:22,170
Can you do that? Hm?

402
00:38:22,200 --> 00:38:25,830
- L'll try.
- Well, good! Let's get to it!

403
00:38:26,920 --> 00:38:29,000
Yes, sir.

404
00:38:35,220 --> 00:38:37,770
Is there something else?

405
00:38:37,800 --> 00:38:40,050
Sir, it may be none of my business

406
00:38:40,100 --> 00:38:45,020
but some of the men are
particularly upset about the fact

407
00:38:45,060 --> 00:38:49,320
that you keep raising the number
of missions they have to fly.

408
00:38:51,980 --> 00:38:55,080
- You're right, Chaplain.
- L am, sir?

409
00:38:55,110 --> 00:38:59,250
That it's none of your business.
And it's none of theirs either.

410
00:38:59,280 --> 00:39:02,000
Their business is to fly missions.

411
00:39:02,040 --> 00:39:04,920
Your business is to
think up catchy prayers

412
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:07,880
that'll get me into
the Saturday Evening Post.

413
00:39:07,920 --> 00:39:10,890
- Good afternoon, Chaplain!
- Yes, sir.

414
00:39:13,550 --> 00:39:18,020
- Excuse me.
- Excuse me, Padre.

415
00:39:23,100 --> 00:39:28,100
He says the men are upset because l
keep raising the number of missions.

416
00:39:28,150 --> 00:39:30,530
- Yossarian.
- What?

417
00:39:30,560 --> 00:39:35,150
It's that Captain Yossarian. He's
always bitching and making trouble.

418
00:39:35,190 --> 00:39:39,460
- What can we do about it?
- What would General Dreedle do?

419
00:39:39,780 --> 00:39:41,670
He'd crush him.

420
00:39:41,700 --> 00:39:44,090
- Tear him apart!
- Smack him in the face!

421
00:39:44,120 --> 00:39:46,170
- Jab him in the kidneys!
- Kick him in the balls!

422
00:39:53,500 --> 00:39:57,350
Keep your head down
between your legs.

423
00:39:57,380 --> 00:39:59,940
Try to breathe deeply and evenly.

424
00:39:59,970 --> 00:40:04,190
I'm sorry, Captain.
I know how that must feel.

425
00:40:04,220 --> 00:40:06,720
- L don't think so.
- Try not to talk.

426
00:40:06,770 --> 00:40:09,610
Just think about nice things.

427
00:40:09,650 --> 00:40:12,620
Think about how lovely it is here,

428
00:40:12,650 --> 00:40:18,080
how lovely it could be if someone
didn't always try to spoil it.

429
00:40:18,110 --> 00:40:21,710
- Why do you always try to spoil it?
- Because l love you.

430
00:40:21,740 --> 00:40:24,840
I know that, Captain. l know that.

431
00:40:24,870 --> 00:40:29,010
But this is wartime.
We've got a job to do, soldier.

432
00:40:29,040 --> 00:40:33,000
We just can't give in to ourselves.
Think how it is for me.

433
00:40:33,040 --> 00:40:37,630
One of a handful of women
on an island with thousands of men.

434
00:40:37,670 --> 00:40:42,150
Men who are giving up their lives
for our country, for me.

435
00:40:42,180 --> 00:40:45,800
Think about... Captain Yossarian!

436
00:40:45,850 --> 00:40:48,490
What are you doing?

437
00:40:48,520 --> 00:40:50,600
Listen, l'm gonna die.

438
00:40:50,640 --> 00:40:53,820
- No, no. No, no, no, no.
- Yes, mm!

439
00:40:53,860 --> 00:40:58,360
Oh, God. Oh...

440
00:40:58,400 --> 00:41:02,030
What is it?

441
00:41:02,070 --> 00:41:04,410
- What's the matter?
- Oh!

442
00:41:04,450 --> 00:41:09,590
The name of the town is Ferrara
and it's right around here.

443
00:41:09,620 --> 00:41:13,170
It's a very pretty town,
on the coast...

444
00:41:15,800 --> 00:41:18,810
- You all right?
- Lt's her, it's her!

445
00:41:18,840 --> 00:41:22,130
- Who? Who?
- Dreedle's WAC!

446
00:41:22,180 --> 00:41:26,730
If you do your job well,
there won't be much left, anyway.

447
00:41:27,810 --> 00:41:32,730
Intelligence reports indicate you
shouldn't have to worry about flak.

448
00:41:32,770 --> 00:41:36,780
We were hoping for some
new recon photos of the area.

449
00:41:36,820 --> 00:41:41,620
Unfortunately, they haven't arrived
but then, no news is good news.

450
00:41:41,650 --> 00:41:43,990
A lot of you may ask yourselves,

451
00:41:44,030 --> 00:41:47,990
"How come we're out
to destroy a town with no industry,

452
00:41:48,040 --> 00:41:50,670
"no enemy bases,
no strategic value to anyone?"

453
00:41:53,750 --> 00:41:55,830
Attention!

454
00:42:04,430 --> 00:42:08,020
As you were.
Good morning, gentlemen.

455
00:42:08,060 --> 00:42:12,530
We're honoured to have
General Dreedle at today's briefing.

456
00:42:12,560 --> 00:42:16,610
Don't pay any attention to me,
just carry on as usual.

457
00:42:16,650 --> 00:42:20,870
- Don't pay any attention to Dad.
- Will you clam up?

458
00:42:22,070 --> 00:42:24,290
Don't call me Dad.

459
00:42:24,320 --> 00:42:29,880
- Go ahead with your briefing, Major.
- Yes, well... Thank you, sir.

460
00:42:30,950 --> 00:42:33,760
I was just telling
the men here that...

461
00:42:33,790 --> 00:42:37,890
- Don't tell me. Tell them!
- Tell the men, Danby.

462
00:42:39,380 --> 00:42:43,770
Yes. l was just explaining
why we're going to obliterate...

463
00:42:43,800 --> 00:42:46,900
- What about a chair?
- Sir?

464
00:42:49,310 --> 00:42:52,150
- A chair.
- L beg your pardon, General?

465
00:42:52,180 --> 00:42:54,900
A chair!

466
00:42:54,940 --> 00:42:57,570
Doesn't anyone know what a chair is?!

467
00:43:01,110 --> 00:43:03,660
Can't you see a lady is standing?

468
00:43:03,690 --> 00:43:06,660
A chair for Dad's gir... for the lady!

469
00:43:22,210 --> 00:43:24,180
Carry on.

470
00:43:24,220 --> 00:43:27,840
We're now going
to synchronize our watches.

471
00:43:27,890 --> 00:43:30,270
Now, we've all done this before,

472
00:43:30,300 --> 00:43:33,430
so l don't think
we're going to have any problem.

473
00:43:34,770 --> 00:43:40,200
If everyone will be kind enough to
look down at his watch, we'll begin.

474
00:43:40,230 --> 00:43:46,080
It is now 1 1 15 hours minus 50...

475
00:43:46,110 --> 00:43:49,740
- 49, 48, 47...
- Mmm.

476
00:43:49,780 --> 00:43:54,500
46, 45, 44, 43...

477
00:43:54,540 --> 00:43:57,010
- Mmmmm.
- Yossarian.

478
00:43:57,040 --> 00:44:02,430
- Ohh... Oh-oh...
- ..40, 39, 38, 37...

479
00:44:02,460 --> 00:44:04,960
..36, 35...

480
00:44:05,010 --> 00:44:09,060
- ..34, 33, 32...
- Mmm.

481
00:44:09,090 --> 00:44:12,220
- ..31, 30...
- Ohh-oh...

482
00:44:12,260 --> 00:44:16,930
..29, 28, 27...

483
00:44:16,980 --> 00:44:21,530
..26, 25, 24...

484
00:44:21,560 --> 00:44:27,280
- Somebody's gonna get it!
- ..22, 21, 20...

485
00:44:27,320 --> 00:44:31,170
..19, 18, 1 7...

486
00:44:31,200 --> 00:44:36,170
..16, 15, 1 4, 1 3, 1 2...

487
00:44:36,200 --> 00:44:40,160
- All right, at ease!
- ..1 1, 10, 9...

488
00:44:40,210 --> 00:44:43,890
There'll be no more moaning
in this outfit.

489
00:44:43,920 --> 00:44:47,970
The next man who moans
is going to be very sorry.

490
00:44:48,010 --> 00:44:49,520
..one!

491
00:44:51,340 --> 00:44:53,760
Ohhh.

492
00:44:56,390 --> 00:44:59,190
Who is this man?

493
00:44:59,230 --> 00:45:02,270
- Major Danby, sir.
- Danby. D-A-N-B-Y.

494
00:45:02,310 --> 00:45:04,950
- Take him out and shoot him.
- Sir?

495
00:45:04,980 --> 00:45:09,950
- L said shoot him.
- Take Major Danby out and shoot him.

496
00:45:09,990 --> 00:45:12,870
I think you'd better
wait a minute, Dad.

497
00:45:12,910 --> 00:45:15,750
- What?
- L don't think you can shoot him.

498
00:45:15,790 --> 00:45:17,950
Why the hell can't l?

499
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:20,050
Why not?

500
00:45:20,080 --> 00:45:23,260
You mean l can't shoot
whoever l want to?

501
00:45:23,290 --> 00:45:26,260
- Ls that a fact?
- L'm afraid it is, Dad.

502
00:45:26,300 --> 00:45:29,220
You think you're pretty smart,
don't you?

503
00:45:29,260 --> 00:45:33,760
Just because my half-wit daughter
married you for some reason...

504
00:45:33,800 --> 00:45:35,640
Oh, no, Dad, it's just...

505
00:45:35,680 --> 00:45:39,820
Let the insubordinate son of a bitch
go but get him out of here.

506
00:45:41,940 --> 00:45:45,700
- Better do something.
- All right, men, l think we...

507
00:45:45,730 --> 00:45:50,570
owe a vote of thanks to the General
for visiting us and cheering us up.

508
00:45:50,610 --> 00:45:53,500
In his honour,
l'd like to make an announcement

509
00:45:53,530 --> 00:45:55,610
which may be of interest.

510
00:45:55,660 --> 00:45:58,380
I know you're anxious
to do your part...

511
00:45:58,410 --> 00:46:00,160
Here it comes.

512
00:46:00,200 --> 00:46:03,970
As of now,
the number of missions required

513
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:08,140
before you are eligible for rotation
is raised to 75.

514
00:46:08,170 --> 00:46:12,560
I know we'll all do our best.
Ten-hut!

515
00:46:16,850 --> 00:46:20,860
What are you smiling at,
you silly bastard?

516
00:46:20,890 --> 00:46:23,650
- Now l won't have to go home.
- You what?

517
00:46:23,690 --> 00:46:26,270
I can stay.
I don't have to leave her.

518
00:46:26,310 --> 00:46:30,080
- What are you saying?
- L love her.

519
00:46:31,820 --> 00:46:37,530
I do. l really do. l've never felt
like this, not even for my mom.

520
00:46:37,580 --> 00:46:40,050
Men don't fall for girls like that.

521
00:46:40,080 --> 00:46:42,630
Men always fall for girls like that.

522
00:46:42,660 --> 00:46:44,970
Ah, one or the other.

523
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:47,760
I'm gonna take her back
to Long lsland.

524
00:46:47,790 --> 00:46:51,340
You don't really love her.
You think you love her.

525
00:46:51,380 --> 00:46:55,880
How can you tell the difference
between love and thinking it's love?

526
00:46:55,930 --> 00:46:58,970
- You have to be objective.
- Who's objective?

527
00:46:59,010 --> 00:47:01,860
I am,
because l'm not in love with her.

528
00:47:01,890 --> 00:47:04,740
- You mean you think you're not.
- Right.

529
00:47:04,770 --> 00:47:07,320
Then how can you tell the difference?

530
00:47:07,350 --> 00:47:09,410
Wait a second...

531
00:47:09,440 --> 00:47:12,240
Hey, look!

532
00:47:12,280 --> 00:47:16,950
- Look what Aarfy's got.
- Say goodbye, McWatt. Come on!

533
00:47:16,990 --> 00:47:21,740
- Figli Di puttana!
- My dear, we had a lovely day.

534
00:47:21,790 --> 00:47:26,050
Did you see what he did?
Make him tell you what he did.

535
00:47:28,630 --> 00:47:32,960
- What'd you do, Aarfy?
- Nothing. Nice girl. Very nice girl.

536
00:47:33,010 --> 00:47:36,970
She wanted us to go home with her
to show us a good time.

537
00:47:37,010 --> 00:47:41,230
We had a good time. We saw
the Colosseum and other swell sights.

538
00:47:41,260 --> 00:47:45,490
- Why didn't you take her home?
- L can't take advantage of a kid.

539
00:47:45,520 --> 00:47:49,230
- Old Aarfy's got some principles.
- You've got a diseased mind.

540
00:47:49,270 --> 00:47:51,660
She just wanted to jump in the sack.

541
00:47:51,690 --> 00:47:54,820
She's mixed up.
I gave her a good talking to.

542
00:47:54,860 --> 00:47:56,860
He did!

543
00:47:56,900 --> 00:47:59,830
I straightened her out
and sent her home.

544
00:47:59,870 --> 00:48:02,790
- You crazy bastard!
- You're beneath contempt.

545
00:48:02,830 --> 00:48:06,200
- He's got a dirty mind.
- L don't see it that way.

546
00:48:06,250 --> 00:48:09,340
- They want us to go home with them.
- How much?

547
00:48:09,380 --> 00:48:11,590
- $30!
- Who's the little runt?

548
00:48:11,630 --> 00:48:13,540
Nately's whore's kid sister.

549
00:48:13,590 --> 00:48:17,100
I wanna spend some time with my girl.
L'll pay for us.

550
00:48:17,130 --> 00:48:20,400
Give her the 30 bucks
and send the other two away.

551
00:48:20,430 --> 00:48:23,150
She'll be angry with me
for making her work.

552
00:48:23,180 --> 00:48:26,940
She said if l really loved her,
l'd sleep with the other two.

553
00:48:26,980 --> 00:48:29,060
I swear, you fellas...!

554
00:48:29,980 --> 00:48:32,400
Come on, Yossarian, let's go!

555
00:48:33,650 --> 00:48:35,730
Go on, you go.

556
00:48:36,320 --> 00:48:39,700
- What's wrong?
- What isn't wrong?

557
00:48:39,740 --> 00:48:44,240
- Two more missions and we go home.
- You know what's gonna happen.

558
00:48:44,290 --> 00:48:48,300
No. Some replacement
pilots came into Naples yesterday.

559
00:48:48,330 --> 00:48:49,800
- Who says?
- Milo.

560
00:48:49,830 --> 00:48:52,590
He just left there
with loads of coconuts.

561
00:48:52,630 --> 00:48:56,250
We'll never see those replacements
or those coconuts.

562
00:48:56,300 --> 00:48:59,560
Cathcart wouldn't dare
raise the number again.

563
00:48:59,590 --> 00:49:04,260
Who's gonna stop him?

564
00:49:04,310 --> 00:49:06,560
Somebody will.

565
00:49:11,270 --> 00:49:13,350
Come on!

566
00:49:16,440 --> 00:49:20,460
Nately! Hey, Nately, wait for me!

567
00:51:21,230 --> 00:51:25,460
All right. l want to get this clear.

568
00:51:26,530 --> 00:51:31,450
As l see it, we're giving these men
medals for doing a lousy job, right?

569
00:51:31,490 --> 00:51:33,710
That's not quite the situation.

570
00:51:33,750 --> 00:51:38,250
When l want you, l'll look at you,
which will be as seldom as possible.

571
00:51:38,290 --> 00:51:40,540
- L can explain it.
- You better.

572
00:51:40,590 --> 00:51:44,430
Yesterday's mission was to bomb
a town called Ferrara.

573
00:51:44,470 --> 00:51:45,730
Ferrara?

574
00:51:45,760 --> 00:51:49,690
- Why Ferrara?
- What do you mean, "Why Ferrara?"

575
00:51:49,720 --> 00:51:53,980
- Do you know what Ferrara is?
- Lt's a town on a hill.

576
00:51:54,020 --> 00:51:57,730
- Do you know what's in that town?
- Five minutes to target.

577
00:51:57,770 --> 00:51:59,850
- What's in it?
- Nothing.

578
00:51:59,900 --> 00:52:03,950
- What?
- Nothing. No Germans, no munitions,

579
00:52:03,980 --> 00:52:07,610
no railroad crossing,
no harbour, nothing.

580
00:52:08,700 --> 00:52:13,920
- Nothing at all?
- No, except people. ltalian people.

581
00:52:13,950 --> 00:52:16,200
And a monastery.

582
00:52:17,460 --> 00:52:21,140
Yossarian, maybe it's some kind
of strategy thing.

583
00:52:22,210 --> 00:52:26,850
- What the hell are we doing?
- Lt's not our business to ask.

584
00:52:26,880 --> 00:52:29,810
- Whose business is it?
- Four minutes.

585
00:52:29,840 --> 00:52:33,390
- Are you ready to go in?
- Get ready to dump.

586
00:52:33,430 --> 00:52:36,530
- We're not there yet!
- Get away, Aardvark!

587
00:52:36,560 --> 00:52:40,160
- You'll screw up the whole mission!
- What's going on?

588
00:52:40,230 --> 00:52:42,990
- Get ready to turn!
- What are you doing?

589
00:52:43,020 --> 00:52:46,200
- Cut it out, Yossarian!
- Get ready to turn!

590
00:52:56,870 --> 00:53:00,380
A direct hit... on the ocean?

591
00:53:00,420 --> 00:53:03,300
Yes, sir. A marvellous bomb pattern.

592
00:53:03,340 --> 00:53:06,930
We have aerial photographs
if you'd like to see them.

593
00:53:06,960 --> 00:53:11,880
We're decorating men who dropped
20 tons of very expensive bombs

594
00:53:11,930 --> 00:53:16,320
- on the Mediterranean?
- Lf you consider the alternative...

595
00:53:16,350 --> 00:53:21,070
The alternative is that we take
the whole crew out and shoot 'em.

596
00:53:21,100 --> 00:53:25,030
- Might be a problem there, sir.
- All right, l know.

597
00:53:25,070 --> 00:53:29,700
If we can't shoot the sons
of bitches, we can court-martial 'em,

598
00:53:29,740 --> 00:53:32,370
see that they rot in some stockade.

599
00:53:32,410 --> 00:53:37,750
Well, sir, we felt a court martial
might get unavoidable publicity.

600
00:53:37,790 --> 00:53:42,540
If it got around that we used one
of our missions to bomb the ocean...

601
00:53:42,580 --> 00:53:45,930
You don't have to say
anything more, Colonel.

602
00:53:45,960 --> 00:53:50,300
Ho! Ten-hut! Right shoulder!

603
00:53:53,010 --> 00:53:54,760
Ten-hut!

604
00:54:04,400 --> 00:54:09,370
"For distinguished duty in the face
of overwhelming" something...

605
00:54:09,400 --> 00:54:11,120
- Odds.
- "..odds,

606
00:54:11,150 --> 00:54:15,210
"this Air Medal is awarded
to Captain JS..."

607
00:54:15,240 --> 00:54:17,570
- McWatt.
- "..McWatt."

608
00:54:22,620 --> 00:54:24,790
Come on, come on.

609
00:54:28,590 --> 00:54:32,270
All right, McWatt.
What are you waiting for, a kiss?

610
00:54:32,300 --> 00:54:36,350
- Get back in there.
- And on the double!

611
00:54:36,390 --> 00:54:38,690
"For meritorious action

612
00:54:38,720 --> 00:54:43,560
"in the face of concentrated
enemy fire, Captain..."

613
00:54:43,600 --> 00:54:45,820
- What's this?
- Come on, dumbo.

614
00:54:45,860 --> 00:54:48,700
- Yossarian, sir.
- "Yossarian."

615
00:55:02,290 --> 00:55:05,410
Unless l miss my guess, Captain...

616
00:55:06,750 --> 00:55:09,960
you're out of uniform.

617
00:55:11,510 --> 00:55:14,390
What are you looking at?

618
00:55:14,430 --> 00:55:18,140
Get back in the car,
you smirking slut.

619
00:55:24,310 --> 00:55:27,850
Why aren't you
wearing clothes, Captain?

620
00:55:27,900 --> 00:55:33,240
- L don't want to.
- What do you mean? Why don't you?

621
00:55:33,280 --> 00:55:35,580
I dunno, l just don't want to.

622
00:55:35,610 --> 00:55:39,670
- Why isn't he wearing clothes?
- He's talking to you.

623
00:55:39,700 --> 00:55:43,880
- Why is he naked, Major?
- Why is he naked, Sergeant?

624
00:55:43,910 --> 00:55:47,210
A man was killed in his plane
and bled all over him.

625
00:55:47,250 --> 00:55:49,250
His clothes are in the laundry.

626
00:55:49,290 --> 00:55:52,810
- His other uniforms?
- Ln the laundry, sir.

627
00:55:52,840 --> 00:55:56,770
- Where is his underwear?
- Ln the laundry, sir.

628
00:55:57,930 --> 00:56:01,720
- That sounds like a lot of crap.
- Lt is a lot of crap, sir.

629
00:56:01,760 --> 00:56:05,140
Sir, on my word this man
will be punished severely.

630
00:56:05,180 --> 00:56:08,110
What the hell do l care?

631
00:56:08,150 --> 00:56:11,660
If he wants to receive a medal
without any clothes on,

632
00:56:11,690 --> 00:56:13,740
what business is it of yours?

633
00:56:13,780 --> 00:56:18,160
- My sentiments exactly, sir.
- Here's your medal, Captain.

634
00:56:20,160 --> 00:56:23,780
You're a very weird person,
Yossarian.

635
00:56:23,830 --> 00:56:25,090
Thank you, sir.

636
00:56:30,540 --> 00:56:32,710
- You are giving me this?
- Yes.

637
00:56:32,750 --> 00:56:35,170
- Perché?
- Because you're beautiful

638
00:56:35,210 --> 00:56:38,920
and because your name is Luciana -
my mother's name.

639
00:56:38,970 --> 00:56:42,810
But my name is Eleonora Rosanna,
l only call myself Luciana.

640
00:56:42,850 --> 00:56:46,110
Hey, my mother
only called herself Luciana!

641
00:56:46,140 --> 00:56:48,480
Her real name was Eleonora Rosanna.

642
00:56:48,520 --> 00:56:52,480
- L don't believe you.
- L don't blame you.

643
00:56:54,780 --> 00:56:57,360
What you get this for?

644
00:56:57,400 --> 00:57:00,370
- Will you believe the truth?
- Yes.

645
00:57:00,410 --> 00:57:05,490
OK. l was awarded that
particular medal for killing fish.

646
00:57:05,540 --> 00:57:10,590
- Oh. You have killed many fish?
- Yes, l am one of the biggest...

647
00:57:10,620 --> 00:57:16,140
l am the most renowned killer of fish
in the whole US Army Air Force.

648
00:57:16,170 --> 00:57:18,090
OK.

649
00:57:19,180 --> 00:57:22,770
I dance with you
but l won't let you sleep with me.

650
00:57:22,800 --> 00:57:26,010
- Who asked you?
- You don't want to sleep with me?

651
00:57:26,060 --> 00:57:29,490
- L don't wanna dance with you.
- You crazy.

652
00:57:34,190 --> 00:57:38,240
- Watch where you put your hands, Gl.
- My name is Yossarian.

653
00:57:38,280 --> 00:57:41,820
Watch where you put your hands,
Yossarian.

654
00:59:09,160 --> 00:59:11,800
It's, uh...

655
00:59:11,830 --> 00:59:15,540
- What's his name, the new gunner?
- 'Snowden.'

656
00:59:15,580 --> 00:59:17,670
Yeah.

657
00:59:20,380 --> 00:59:23,100
Snowden.

658
00:59:23,130 --> 00:59:25,020
I'm cold.

659
00:59:25,050 --> 00:59:28,510
OK. You're gonna be OK.

660
00:59:28,550 --> 00:59:31,570
I'm cold. Cold.

661
00:59:47,110 --> 00:59:50,710
- There.
- Starting to hurt me.

662
00:59:50,740 --> 00:59:54,590
OK. Hang on,
l'll get you some morphine.

663
01:00:21,360 --> 01:00:23,610
Milo!

664
01:00:26,200 --> 01:00:28,080
- You prick!
- Hi! What's up?

665
01:00:28,110 --> 01:00:32,040
Hey, it's good to see you.
When did you get out of the hospital?

666
01:00:32,080 --> 01:00:34,380
We've got things to talk over.

667
01:00:34,410 --> 01:00:38,800
How you feeling? Sorry l didn't visit
but l've been in Naples.

668
01:00:38,830 --> 01:00:41,880
- About that parachute...
- What parachute?

669
01:00:41,920 --> 01:00:45,100
The one l use if l gotta
jump out of the plane.

670
01:00:45,130 --> 01:00:48,760
Ah, that parachute.
Remember that your parachute

671
01:00:48,800 --> 01:00:52,810
was just one of 60 parachutes
taken over by the Syndicate.

672
01:00:52,850 --> 01:00:57,150
I don't care about the Syndicate.
I don't want your tomatoes!

673
01:00:57,180 --> 01:01:00,810
They're the Syndicate's tomatoes.
Our tomatoes.

674
01:01:00,860 --> 01:01:02,940
Just as these are our statues.

675
01:01:02,980 --> 01:01:07,120
In fact, that's where
all the parachutes went.

676
01:01:07,150 --> 01:01:09,740
You traded my parachute for statues?

677
01:01:09,780 --> 01:01:13,320
No. l traded our diesel engines
for the statues.

678
01:01:13,370 --> 01:01:16,710
- L don't have any engines!
- Not "your", "our".

679
01:01:16,750 --> 01:01:19,760
I got the engines
for two planeloads of lumber,

680
01:01:19,790 --> 01:01:22,260
100 pairs of shoes
and the parachutes.

681
01:01:22,290 --> 01:01:26,090
The men aren't gonna be happy
about what you're doing.

682
01:01:26,130 --> 01:01:30,470
Don't they understand? We're gonna
come out of this war rich.

683
01:01:30,510 --> 01:01:34,360
You're gonna come out rich.
We're gonna come out dead!

684
01:01:35,430 --> 01:01:39,110
- What does he want?
- Who?

685
01:01:39,140 --> 01:01:41,230
Hungry Joe.

686
01:01:43,610 --> 01:01:47,040
- What is the matter?
- L got a feeling.

687
01:01:49,360 --> 01:01:51,530
- L think it is.
- What?

688
01:01:51,570 --> 01:01:53,570
- Come on.
- What is it?

689
01:01:53,620 --> 01:01:57,630
I don't know
but if it's what l think it is...

690
01:02:01,920 --> 01:02:04,080
lt's just McWatt.

691
01:02:04,130 --> 01:02:07,500
He's been doing it for months.
He's jealous of her.

692
01:02:07,550 --> 01:02:10,560
- She likes you better?
- She likes him better.

693
01:02:10,590 --> 01:02:14,900
- Why doesn't she go out with him?
- Because she can't stand him!

694
01:02:14,930 --> 01:02:16,930
- Good old McWatt.
- Why?

695
01:02:16,970 --> 01:02:19,280
He's carrying me on his manifest.

696
01:02:19,310 --> 01:02:22,680
Every time he goes up,
he files my name as a passenger.

697
01:02:22,730 --> 01:02:24,320
I can get my flight pay

698
01:02:24,360 --> 01:02:28,540
without having to do anything stupid
like going up in a plane.

699
01:02:28,570 --> 01:02:31,610
- Look!
- What is he saying?

700
01:02:33,110 --> 01:02:35,200
He's coming back!

701
01:02:55,930 --> 01:02:58,970
- Who was it?
- Hungry Joe.

702
01:03:08,980 --> 01:03:13,900
We'll have to requisition
a new photographer from Group.

703
01:03:13,950 --> 01:03:16,200
Is there... anything...

704
01:03:17,280 --> 01:03:19,530
l can do?

705
01:03:19,580 --> 01:03:21,910
McWatt's still up there.

706
01:03:23,160 --> 01:03:25,470
Doc Daneeka's up there, too.

707
01:03:26,540 --> 01:03:28,630
I'm right here.

708
01:03:29,880 --> 01:03:31,960
Come on down, McWatt.

709
01:03:32,010 --> 01:03:36,680
Probably afraid to come down, he
knows what kind of trouble he's in.

710
01:03:39,560 --> 01:03:42,900
- He cut his engine.
- McWatt!

711
01:03:45,520 --> 01:03:49,120
Why doesn't Daneeka jump?
He's got a chute.

712
01:03:49,150 --> 01:03:52,490
I'm right here, Sergeant.
I'm not in the plane.

713
01:03:52,530 --> 01:03:54,690
Jump, Doc, jump!

714
01:03:55,780 --> 01:03:59,040
Jump. Jump, Doc...

715
01:03:59,080 --> 01:04:01,160
Please jump.

716
01:04:02,040 --> 01:04:06,510
Jump. Jump!

717
01:04:19,010 --> 01:04:21,100
Poor Hungry Joe.

718
01:04:22,810 --> 01:04:25,110
Poor McWatt.

719
01:04:25,140 --> 01:04:27,450
Poor Doc.

720
01:04:27,480 --> 01:04:30,690
Yeah. Poor Doc.

721
01:04:33,860 --> 01:04:37,620
L'll need a full report on this,
Captain Yossarian.

722
01:04:37,660 --> 01:04:42,740
Yossarian.
I haven't seen you in some time.

723
01:04:44,660 --> 01:04:46,720
Not since...

724
01:04:49,130 --> 01:04:52,470
- Snowden's funeral.
- Snowden.

725
01:04:56,800 --> 01:05:00,310
- Do you want to say something, sir?
- What?

726
01:05:01,390 --> 01:05:05,100
I just wondered
if you wanted to say anything.

727
01:05:05,140 --> 01:05:09,730
No, l didn't actually know
the young fellow.

728
01:05:09,770 --> 01:05:14,860
It was his first mission.
Did you know him, Danby?

729
01:05:14,900 --> 01:05:18,960
No, l don't think l ever
heard the name. What was it?

730
01:05:18,990 --> 01:05:22,110
- Snowden, l think.
- Oh, yes.

731
01:05:23,370 --> 01:05:27,160
Well, l'll just read something.

732
01:05:27,200 --> 01:05:30,180
Yes, you... you do that.

733
01:05:33,630 --> 01:05:38,430
- Ls something wrong?
- No, l just thought l saw something.

734
01:05:41,220 --> 01:05:45,010
- A naked man in a tree?
- Yes, that's it.

735
01:05:49,480 --> 01:05:53,350
- That's just Yossarian.
- Oh.

736
01:05:54,360 --> 01:05:57,950
Oh. Well, in that case...

737
01:05:59,280 --> 01:06:04,790
"The... Lord is my shepherd,
l shall not want.

738
01:06:04,830 --> 01:06:08,170
"He maketh me to lie down
in green pastures..."

739
01:06:08,200 --> 01:06:10,920
Hey!

740
01:06:10,960 --> 01:06:16,040
- L've been looking all over for you.
- You should've looked in this tree.

741
01:06:16,090 --> 01:06:20,510
I don't want to butt in but why
aren't you wearing your uniform?

742
01:06:20,550 --> 01:06:22,850
- L don't want to.
- Aha.

743
01:06:22,890 --> 01:06:28,190
I want you to do something for me.
I want to serve this to the men.

744
01:06:28,220 --> 01:06:31,350
Taste it and let me know
what you think.

745
01:06:34,520 --> 01:06:37,730
- What is it?
- Chocolate-covered cotton.

746
01:06:38,940 --> 01:06:41,030
- Are you crazy?
- No good?

747
01:06:41,070 --> 01:06:43,240
You didn't take the seeds out!

748
01:06:43,280 --> 01:06:45,960
- Ls it really that bad?
- Lt's cotton!

749
01:06:45,990 --> 01:06:48,750
- They've got to learn to like it.
- Why?

750
01:06:48,790 --> 01:06:53,050
I saw a chance to corner the market,
l didn't know there'd be a glut.

751
01:06:53,080 --> 01:06:57,260
L've got warehouses full all over
Europe. l can't get rid of it.

752
01:06:57,290 --> 01:07:00,890
People eat cotton candy.
This is better, it's real cotton.

753
01:07:00,920 --> 01:07:05,340
- People can't eat cotton!
- They've got to, for the Syndicate.

754
01:07:05,390 --> 01:07:09,570
It will make them sick. Try it
yourself if you don't believe me.

755
01:07:09,600 --> 01:07:12,780
I did and it made me sick.

756
01:07:15,520 --> 01:07:17,940
Look at that. Looks like a funeral.

757
01:07:17,980 --> 01:07:20,990
It's that kid
that got killed in my plane.

758
01:07:21,030 --> 01:07:25,290
- Oh? What happened to him?
- He got killed.

759
01:07:26,700 --> 01:07:30,460
- What?
- L said he got killed.

760
01:07:30,490 --> 01:07:32,800
I'm sorry.

761
01:07:36,210 --> 01:07:40,220
- He was your friend?
- Maybe, l don't know.

762
01:07:42,550 --> 01:07:45,670
- He was very old.
- But he was a boy.

763
01:07:45,720 --> 01:07:49,150
Well, he died.
You don't get any older than that.

764
01:08:00,440 --> 01:08:03,570
- Where do you work?
- L'm not a whore.

765
01:08:03,610 --> 01:08:05,690
I didn't say you were.

766
01:08:05,740 --> 01:08:09,110
- L work in big American company.
- Me, too!

767
01:08:10,990 --> 01:08:13,240
- You want to see me again?
- Mm.

768
01:08:13,290 --> 01:08:16,050
- Why?
- Why not?

769
01:08:17,210 --> 01:08:19,380
You think l'm beautiful?

770
01:08:19,420 --> 01:08:23,050
- L think you're perfect.
- That's not true.

771
01:08:23,090 --> 01:08:25,480
- Lt is true.
- No.

772
01:08:26,090 --> 01:08:28,560
See this?

773
01:08:29,640 --> 01:08:33,010
- Jesus, how did you...?
- Air raid.

774
01:08:34,100 --> 01:08:37,390
- Germans?
- Americani.

775
01:08:46,200 --> 01:08:49,170
You do not want me now?

776
01:08:49,200 --> 01:08:52,790
What are you talking about?
I want you everything.

777
01:08:52,830 --> 01:08:55,300
- L want you to marry me.
- You crazy.

778
01:08:55,330 --> 01:08:57,880
- Why?
- You can't want to marry me.

779
01:08:57,920 --> 01:09:00,590
- Why not?
- L'm not a virgin.

780
01:09:00,630 --> 01:09:03,470
- So?
- Nobody wants a girl who isn't.

781
01:09:03,500 --> 01:09:07,210
- L do. l wanna marry you.
- Not possible.

782
01:09:07,260 --> 01:09:09,430
- Why not?
- Because you crazy.

783
01:09:09,470 --> 01:09:12,360
- Why am l crazy?
- Because you want to marry me.

784
01:09:12,390 --> 01:09:17,560
You won't marry me because l'm crazy,
l'm crazy because l wanna marry you?

785
01:09:17,600 --> 01:09:19,940
- You're crazy.
- Why?

786
01:09:21,060 --> 01:09:25,450
Because l love you.
Ti amo. Ti amo molto.

787
01:09:26,490 --> 01:09:30,080
How can you love a girl
who is not a virgin?

788
01:09:30,110 --> 01:09:32,580
Because l can't marry you.

789
01:09:32,620 --> 01:09:36,050
Why you can't marry me?
Because l'm not a virgin?

790
01:09:36,080 --> 01:09:38,160
No, because you're crazy!

791
01:09:38,210 --> 01:09:40,180
- You crazy!
- You're crazy!

792
01:09:41,580 --> 01:09:44,140
- You all crazy!
- Why are we crazy?

793
01:09:44,170 --> 01:09:47,350
Because you don't know
how to stay alive

794
01:09:47,380 --> 01:09:50,020
and that's the secret of life.

795
01:09:50,050 --> 01:09:52,220
But we have a war to win.

796
01:09:52,260 --> 01:09:56,650
Ah. But America will lose the war.
Italy will win it.

797
01:09:56,680 --> 01:09:59,690
America's the strongest nation
on earth.

798
01:09:59,730 --> 01:10:04,730
The American fighter is the best
trained, best equipped, best fed...

799
01:10:04,770 --> 01:10:09,610
Exactly. ltaly, however, is
one of the weakest nations on earth

800
01:10:09,650 --> 01:10:14,790
and the ltalian fighting man
is hardly equipped at all.

801
01:10:14,830 --> 01:10:19,880
That's why my country is doing so
well while yours is doing so poorly.

802
01:10:20,960 --> 01:10:24,140
That's silly!
Italy was occupied by the Germans

803
01:10:24,170 --> 01:10:26,250
and is now being occupied by us.

804
01:10:26,300 --> 01:10:29,140
- You call that doing well?
- Of course l do.

805
01:10:29,170 --> 01:10:33,020
The Germans are being driven out
and we are still here.

806
01:10:33,050 --> 01:10:36,730
In a few years, you'll be gone
and we'll still be here.

807
01:10:36,760 --> 01:10:39,940
You see, ltaly is a very poor,
weak country,

808
01:10:39,980 --> 01:10:43,320
yet that is what makes us so strong,

809
01:10:43,350 --> 01:10:49,200
strong enough to survive this war
and still be in existence

810
01:10:49,240 --> 01:10:52,500
long after your country
has been destroyed.

811
01:10:52,530 --> 01:10:55,880
What are you saying?
America won't be destroyed.

812
01:10:55,910 --> 01:10:59,700
- Never?
- Well...

813
01:10:59,750 --> 01:11:03,040
Rome was destroyed.
Greece was destroyed.

814
01:11:03,080 --> 01:11:07,040
Persia was destroyed.
Spain was destroyed.

815
01:11:07,090 --> 01:11:11,980
All great countries are destroyed.
Why not yours?

816
01:11:12,010 --> 01:11:16,560
How much longer do you think
your country will last?

817
01:11:16,600 --> 01:11:18,260
Forever?

818
01:11:22,810 --> 01:11:26,350
Well, forever is a long time,
l guess.

819
01:11:26,400 --> 01:11:28,280
Very long.

820
01:11:28,320 --> 01:11:30,870
Ciao.

821
01:11:31,990 --> 01:11:35,860
- Please, we're talking.
- We go to bed now?

822
01:11:35,910 --> 01:11:40,960
No. Would you go put some clothes on?
You're practically naked.

823
01:11:41,000 --> 01:11:43,720
Mmm!

824
01:11:43,750 --> 01:11:46,760
I wish she wouldn't
walk around like that.

825
01:11:46,790 --> 01:11:50,000
But it is her business
to walk around like that.

826
01:11:50,050 --> 01:11:53,390
- But it's not nice.
- Of course it's nice.

827
01:11:53,420 --> 01:11:55,890
Mmm, she's nice to look at.

828
01:11:56,970 --> 01:12:01,110
This life is not nice.
I don't want her to do this.

829
01:12:01,140 --> 01:12:05,450
- When we go to America?
- When we go to America?

830
01:12:05,480 --> 01:12:10,950
You will take her to America?
Away from a healthy, active life?

831
01:12:10,980 --> 01:12:16,460
Away from good business
opportunities? Away from her friends?

832
01:12:16,490 --> 01:12:20,910
- Don't you have any principles?
- Of course not.

833
01:12:20,950 --> 01:12:25,170
- No morality?
- L'm a very moral man.

834
01:12:25,210 --> 01:12:29,050
And ltaly is a very moral country.

835
01:12:29,090 --> 01:12:33,100
That's why we will certainly
come out on top again

836
01:12:33,130 --> 01:12:36,340
if we succeed in being defeated.

837
01:12:36,380 --> 01:12:38,350
You talk like a madman.

838
01:12:38,390 --> 01:12:41,650
But l live like a sane one.

839
01:12:43,770 --> 01:12:46,780
I was a Fascist
when Mussolini was on top.

840
01:12:46,810 --> 01:12:51,030
Now that he has been deposed,
l am anti-Fascist.

841
01:12:52,400 --> 01:12:56,620
When the Germans were here,
l was fanatically pro-German.

842
01:12:56,650 --> 01:12:59,370
Now l'm fanatically pro-America!

843
01:13:00,700 --> 01:13:05,790
You'll find no more loyal partisan
in all of ltaly than myself.

844
01:13:06,750 --> 01:13:09,630
You're a shameful opportunist!

845
01:13:09,670 --> 01:13:13,810
It's better to die on your feet
than to live on your knees.

846
01:13:13,840 --> 01:13:16,420
You have it backwards.

847
01:13:16,470 --> 01:13:20,730
It's better to live on your feet
than to die on your knees.

848
01:13:21,800 --> 01:13:25,350
- L know.
- How do you know?

849
01:13:25,390 --> 01:13:29,350
Because l am 107 years old.

850
01:13:32,400 --> 01:13:34,620
How old are you?

851
01:13:35,690 --> 01:13:37,660
L'll be 20 in January.

852
01:13:38,820 --> 01:13:41,320
If you live.

853
01:13:47,710 --> 01:13:51,170
- Ciao, Yossarian.
- Hiya, how are ya?

854
01:13:51,210 --> 01:13:54,970
We gotta go back.
All the leaves have been cancelled.

855
01:13:55,000 --> 01:13:57,720
- Ciao, Yossarian.
- Hello, my dear.

856
01:13:57,760 --> 01:14:01,770
You give me a dollar? l pay you back
when we get to America.

857
01:14:01,800 --> 01:14:06,720
OK. Just one. Just one.
One! Gimme that. Here.

858
01:14:06,770 --> 01:14:09,690
Come on, Dobbs.
Milo's gonna fly us back.

859
01:14:09,730 --> 01:14:12,820
- Why are the leaves cancelled?
- L don't know.

860
01:14:12,860 --> 01:14:15,950
Milo says the base is on
some kind of alert.

861
01:14:15,980 --> 01:14:19,780
Oh, yeah. Cathcart raised
the number of missions to 80.

862
01:14:19,820 --> 01:14:21,650
- 80!
- Yeah.

863
01:14:21,700 --> 01:14:25,460
He's mad because Captain Orr
lost another airplane.

864
01:14:25,490 --> 01:14:27,160
Where?

865
01:14:27,200 --> 01:14:31,540
Ditched coming back from Bologna,
went down in the Mediterranean.

866
01:14:31,580 --> 01:14:33,720
Air-Sea Rescue out there?

867
01:14:35,090 --> 01:14:36,750
Yeah.

868
01:14:36,800 --> 01:14:39,300
They picked up everybody but Orr.

869
01:14:50,680 --> 01:14:54,950
Will you fellas stay away
from the airstrip tonight?

870
01:14:56,020 --> 01:14:59,730
- What for?
- Just do as l say.

871
01:15:00,820 --> 01:15:04,080
- Stay in your tents.
- Why?

872
01:15:06,080 --> 01:15:08,490
- There it is.
- What?

873
01:15:08,540 --> 01:15:10,840
Orr's plane!

874
01:15:12,420 --> 01:15:16,130
Oh, he'll find his way back.
He always does.

875
01:15:16,170 --> 01:15:18,250
He'll turn up,

876
01:15:18,300 --> 01:15:21,590
he'll sneak in
with that rat-toothed giggle.

877
01:15:24,010 --> 01:15:28,680
Aarfy, if anything happens to me,
will you take care of my girl?

878
01:15:28,720 --> 01:15:30,890
Listen to him, "his" girl!

879
01:15:30,930 --> 01:15:33,020
- Yossarian?
- Don't worry.

880
01:15:33,060 --> 01:15:37,620
Nothing's gonna happen to you
that won't happen to the rest of us.

881
01:15:50,490 --> 01:15:52,460
'Orr?

882
01:15:53,540 --> 01:15:55,620
'Orr?'

883
01:15:56,790 --> 01:15:58,930
Orr?

884
01:16:01,260 --> 01:16:03,510
Orr.

885
01:16:04,590 --> 01:16:09,150
- L'll be through in a minute.
- No, you won't. You always say that,

886
01:16:09,180 --> 01:16:13,850
then l watch you fit some tiny thing
into that masterpiece of junk.

887
01:16:13,890 --> 01:16:18,900
- Then l guess you haven't seen it.
- You guess l haven't seen what?

888
01:16:18,940 --> 01:16:23,040
A little square gasket,
about this big.

889
01:16:23,070 --> 01:16:24,900
- Have you seen it?
- No.

890
01:16:24,950 --> 01:16:29,370
- L'll have to start all over again.
- Please don't do that.

891
01:16:29,410 --> 01:16:33,040
- Why?
- Lt gives me a terrible pain.

892
01:16:33,080 --> 01:16:36,370
- Why?
- Why what?

893
01:16:36,420 --> 01:16:38,500
Why won't you fly with me?

894
01:16:38,540 --> 01:16:42,810
What's that got to do with the pain
that you and your bolts give me?

895
01:16:42,840 --> 01:16:45,340
It's got everything to do with it.

896
01:16:45,380 --> 01:16:47,800
Are you trying to tell me something?

897
01:16:47,840 --> 01:16:51,980
Just that if you were smart,
you'd fly with me.

898
01:16:52,010 --> 01:16:55,530
- You've cracked up three planes.
- Four.

899
01:16:55,560 --> 01:16:57,450
I'm a good pilot.

900
01:16:57,480 --> 01:17:00,770
- L don't want to end up in the sea.
- You'd thank me.

901
01:17:00,820 --> 01:17:04,110
- For getting me drowned?
- For finishing this stove.

902
01:17:04,150 --> 01:17:07,500
Winter's coming.
You'll have heat, hot water...

903
01:17:07,530 --> 01:17:10,740
You'll be able to boil eggs
and everything.

904
01:17:10,780 --> 01:17:15,790
- Me? Where are you gonna be?
- L dunno. Here and there.

905
01:17:15,830 --> 01:17:20,050
No one wants to fly with you.
You're a one-man disaster area.

906
01:17:20,080 --> 01:17:24,010
- They're crazy.
- L agree with them.

907
01:17:24,050 --> 01:17:26,130
You're crazy.

908
01:17:55,040 --> 01:17:57,450
Orr?

909
01:18:21,400 --> 01:18:23,480
Orr?

910
01:18:56,760 --> 01:18:58,430
Orr?

911
01:18:58,470 --> 01:19:01,320
- He's dead.
- Who's "he"?

912
01:19:01,350 --> 01:19:03,660
He's just a kid from my home town.

913
01:19:03,690 --> 01:19:07,120
He just died.
They came from the States to see him.

914
01:19:07,150 --> 01:19:09,870
- Get in the bed, will you?
- What?

915
01:19:09,900 --> 01:19:14,540
His mother, father and brother flew
out here. They know he's dying.

916
01:19:14,570 --> 01:19:17,620
- So what do you want me to do?
- Be him.

917
01:19:17,660 --> 01:19:20,870
Just for a few minutes,
then they'll go away.

918
01:19:20,910 --> 01:19:24,460
They came 5,000 miles
to see you before you die.

919
01:19:24,500 --> 01:19:27,760
- L'm not dying.
- Of course you are, we all are.

920
01:19:27,800 --> 01:19:31,060
Doc, they'll know!
They came to see their son.

921
01:19:31,090 --> 01:19:33,260
They'll have to take
what they can get.

922
01:19:33,300 --> 01:19:36,480
One dying boy
is as good as another. Or as bad!

923
01:19:36,510 --> 01:19:39,770
- Lt won't work.
- Look, they've come a long way.

924
01:19:39,810 --> 01:19:44,200
I don't wanna disappoint them.
I'm sentimental about old people.

925
01:19:44,230 --> 01:19:48,560
- What if they start crying?
- They probably will start crying.

926
01:19:48,610 --> 01:19:53,830
L'll wait outside and if it gets
sticky, l'll come in and break it up.

927
01:19:55,240 --> 01:19:57,320
I don't think it's gonna work.

928
01:19:57,370 --> 01:20:00,660
Look, do this for me
and l'll do something for you.

929
01:20:00,700 --> 01:20:03,630
- Will you ground me?
- You know l can't.

930
01:20:03,660 --> 01:20:07,890
You can write a slip saying l'm
on the verge of a nervous collapse.

931
01:20:07,920 --> 01:20:09,840
Sure l can.

932
01:20:19,180 --> 01:20:21,480
But there's a catch.

933
01:20:23,600 --> 01:20:28,240
- Catch-22.
- Group won't approve my action.

934
01:20:28,270 --> 01:20:30,610
They'll put you back on combat status

935
01:20:30,650 --> 01:20:33,150
and send me to rot in
the Pacific Ocean.

936
01:20:33,190 --> 01:20:35,330
God, here they are.

937
01:20:35,360 --> 01:20:37,110
Start dying.

938
01:20:37,160 --> 01:20:41,250
Do this for me and l'll send you
to Rome on a five-day R and R.

939
01:20:59,050 --> 01:21:01,190
He looks terrible.

940
01:21:01,220 --> 01:21:04,520
- He's sick, Pa.
- Harvey?

941
01:21:06,480 --> 01:21:08,390
My name is Yossarian.

942
01:21:08,440 --> 01:21:10,940
His name is Yossarian, Ma.

943
01:21:12,270 --> 01:21:16,120
Yossarian, don't you recognise me?

944
01:21:16,150 --> 01:21:20,250
I'm your brother John.
Don't you know who l am?

945
01:21:20,280 --> 01:21:24,240
- Sure l do. You're my brother John.
- Pa, he knows me.

946
01:21:24,290 --> 01:21:29,460
Yossarian, look, here's Papa.
Say hello to Papa.

947
01:21:29,500 --> 01:21:32,600
- Hello, Papa.
- Hello, Harvey.

948
01:21:32,630 --> 01:21:36,220
- His name is Yossarian, Pa.
- He looks so bad.

949
01:21:36,260 --> 01:21:40,190
He's very sick, Pa.
The doctor says he's gonna die.

950
01:21:41,600 --> 01:21:45,650
- Harvey?
- Ma, his name is Yossarian.

951
01:21:46,730 --> 01:21:50,070
She doesn't remember things too good
any more.

952
01:21:50,100 --> 01:21:54,660
It's OK. She can call me Harvey
if she wants to.

953
01:21:56,150 --> 01:21:58,620
Harvey.

954
01:21:58,650 --> 01:22:00,740
Psst.

955
01:22:03,950 --> 01:22:07,080
Don't worry.
Everything's gonna be all right.

956
01:22:07,120 --> 01:22:09,420
I know.

957
01:22:13,250 --> 01:22:15,500
We came all the way from New York.

958
01:22:15,550 --> 01:22:18,980
We were afraid
we wouldn't get here in time.

959
01:22:19,010 --> 01:22:23,510
- Ln time for what?
- Ln time to see you before you died.

960
01:22:24,600 --> 01:22:27,180
What difference would it make?

961
01:22:27,220 --> 01:22:30,650
We didn't want you to die
by yourself.

962
01:22:30,690 --> 01:22:33,020
What difference would it make?

963
01:22:33,060 --> 01:22:37,240
He's getting delirious,
he keeps repeating the same thing.

964
01:22:37,280 --> 01:22:41,210
- Harvey.
- Lt's not Harvey, it's Yossarian.

965
01:22:41,240 --> 01:22:44,250
What difference does it make?
He's dying.

966
01:23:11,020 --> 01:23:15,120
Listen, kid. lt's-it's not bad.

967
01:23:19,030 --> 01:23:21,750
I'm gonna put a tourniquet on it.

968
01:23:54,940 --> 01:23:59,940
There. lt's good.
It's a good bandage.

969
01:23:59,980 --> 01:24:02,540
I'm cold.

970
01:24:02,570 --> 01:24:05,290
Cold. God.

971
01:24:05,320 --> 01:24:09,990
It's gonna be OK, kid.
We'll be home soon.

972
01:24:21,760 --> 01:24:24,520
- Does the leg still hurt?
- No.

973
01:24:30,970 --> 01:24:32,440
'Hey, Yossarian?'

974
01:24:34,140 --> 01:24:37,770
- You in there?
- Orr?

975
01:24:37,810 --> 01:24:42,290
- Ls that Orr, you son of a bitch?
- Lt's me, Nately.

976
01:24:42,320 --> 01:24:46,160
Nately. What's happening?
Jesus, it's 3:30 in the morning.

977
01:24:46,200 --> 01:24:50,870
It's Dobbs, we've gotta stop him.
He's gonna kill the Colonel.

978
01:24:50,910 --> 01:24:53,160
- Cathcart?
- Yes.

979
01:24:53,200 --> 01:24:55,840
Dobbs is gonna kill Colonel Cathcart?

980
01:25:34,660 --> 01:25:36,800
What's the matter with you?

981
01:25:36,830 --> 01:25:39,630
Nothing. lt's the first sane thing
l've ever done.

982
01:25:39,670 --> 01:25:43,540
- They'll get you for murder!
- Cathcart's the murderer!

983
01:25:43,590 --> 01:25:46,850
- Come on, gimme the gun!
- Take it easy.

984
01:25:46,880 --> 01:25:50,310
- You just got a few more missions.
- You're crazy!

985
01:25:50,340 --> 01:25:53,470
He'll raise the number again
and you know it!

986
01:25:53,510 --> 01:25:56,860
He'll keep us flying missions
till we're all dead.

987
01:25:56,890 --> 01:25:58,980
What the hell do you care?

988
01:25:59,020 --> 01:26:02,730
You don't wanna go home,
you're in love with that whore.

989
01:26:02,770 --> 01:26:05,660
You happen to be talking about
my fiancée.

990
01:26:05,690 --> 01:26:08,820
The fiancée of any guy
with ten bucks,

991
01:26:08,860 --> 01:26:11,360
who's happy to risk a dose of disease

992
01:26:11,410 --> 01:26:15,000
for 15 minutes of phoney moans
on a dirty mattress!

993
01:26:16,080 --> 01:26:18,630
Nately!

994
01:26:28,590 --> 01:26:31,010
Nately? Nately!

995
01:26:33,510 --> 01:26:38,100
Yossarian... l think l hurt him.

996
01:26:46,320 --> 01:26:48,820
Aw, he'll be all right.

997
01:26:48,860 --> 01:26:52,210
Here he comes!

998
01:26:52,240 --> 01:26:54,460
- Gimme the gun!
- No, listen!

999
01:26:54,490 --> 01:26:58,760
If he raises the number again,
l swear l'll help you kill him!

1000
01:26:58,790 --> 01:27:01,260
- Really?
- L swear it.

1001
01:27:01,290 --> 01:27:03,970
That's very reasonable of you.

1002
01:27:04,000 --> 01:27:07,630
- Something's going on.
- What?

1003
01:27:07,670 --> 01:27:10,960
Milo and the Colonel
are up to something.

1004
01:27:11,010 --> 01:27:12,760
They've been planning.

1005
01:27:12,800 --> 01:27:15,610
- What's he doing?
- Something. l dunno.

1006
01:27:26,610 --> 01:27:30,290
Why didn't they turn their lights on?
What the fuck?

1007
01:27:37,790 --> 01:27:39,840
Yossarian, listen!

1008
01:27:42,750 --> 01:27:46,890
- What is this?
- Look!

1009
01:27:53,380 --> 01:27:55,850
Jesus Christ!

1010
01:27:55,890 --> 01:27:59,320
Run, run, run!

1011
01:28:16,990 --> 01:28:19,210
OK, Number 1 and 2, that was good.

1012
01:28:19,240 --> 01:28:21,330
'Thank you. What now?'

1013
01:28:21,370 --> 01:28:25,470
Bank left and wait for instructions.
All right, Number 3.

1014
01:28:25,500 --> 01:28:29,760
Be careful not to hit our storehouses
at the end of the field.

1015
01:28:29,800 --> 01:28:34,430
Direct hit on the mess hall,
if you please. And Number 3...

1016
01:28:34,470 --> 01:28:37,440
Hold on, Number 3.

1017
01:28:37,470 --> 01:28:40,360
- Yossarian, get off the field.
- What?

1018
01:28:40,390 --> 01:28:44,610
'Take cover. You, too, Dobbs.
Number 3, let 'em go.'

1019
01:28:50,980 --> 01:28:52,950
Bastards! Get out of here!

1020
01:28:52,990 --> 01:28:56,580
'Cut that out. Those are our men
you're shooting at.

1021
01:28:56,610 --> 01:28:59,460
'This is
an M&M Enterprises operation.

1022
01:29:03,200 --> 01:29:06,630
'Number 4 and 5, Number 3
did not get those supply sheds.

1023
01:29:06,670 --> 01:29:10,890
'l told you men to come in low.
Right on target this time.

1024
01:29:10,920 --> 01:29:13,220
'Shoddy work will not do.'

1025
01:29:16,590 --> 01:29:18,900
Dobbs!

1026
01:29:30,400 --> 01:29:34,160
What are you doing, Yossarian?
Get off the field!

1027
01:29:37,320 --> 01:29:41,380
You're confined to the base.
I won't forget this.

1028
01:29:41,410 --> 01:29:45,550
- The Air Force won't forget this.
- Don't be ridiculous!

1029
01:29:45,580 --> 01:29:48,760
What's good for M&M
is good for the Air Force.

1030
01:29:48,790 --> 01:29:52,750
- There goes the bomb dump!
- We had to get rid of that cotton.

1031
01:29:52,800 --> 01:29:57,270
The Germans promised to take it off
us if we ran this mission for them.

1032
01:29:57,300 --> 01:30:01,400
- Lt's all part of the deal.
- There goes the Officers Club!

1033
01:30:01,430 --> 01:30:03,900
You made a deal to bomb our own base?

1034
01:30:03,930 --> 01:30:08,240
A contract is a contract.
That's what we're fighting for.

1035
01:30:08,270 --> 01:30:12,200
'Lieutenant Minderbinder
speaking. Clear the field!

1036
01:30:12,230 --> 01:30:16,790
- 'We will soon begin to strafe.'
- Strafe?

1037
01:30:16,820 --> 01:30:21,080
- Lt's all part of the contract.
- There goes Headquarters!

1038
01:30:26,750 --> 01:30:28,830
Nately!

1039
01:30:30,170 --> 01:30:32,250
Nately!

1040
01:30:33,000 --> 01:30:35,090
Nately!

1041
01:30:40,260 --> 01:30:42,340
Nately!

1042
01:30:48,180 --> 01:30:50,270
Nately!

1043
01:30:51,810 --> 01:30:53,560
What's that?

1044
01:30:53,610 --> 01:30:56,410
- He said, "Nately".
- Nately is dead.

1045
01:30:56,440 --> 01:30:59,490
- L know.
- Who's dead?

1046
01:30:59,530 --> 01:31:03,160
You will be
if we don't get at that knife wound.

1047
01:31:03,200 --> 01:31:06,290
- What's happening?
- We're going to operate.

1048
01:31:06,330 --> 01:31:08,740
We're gonna take a look inside you.

1049
01:31:08,790 --> 01:31:11,880
We're gonna clean you out
and stitch you up.

1050
01:31:14,420 --> 01:31:19,590
- Hey! Yossarian!
- Hmm?

1051
01:31:19,630 --> 01:31:23,480
- We've got your pal.
- Hmm?

1052
01:31:23,510 --> 01:31:27,610
You heard me. We've got your pal.

1053
01:31:28,680 --> 01:31:30,650
Who... who's my pal? Who?

1054
01:31:30,680 --> 01:31:33,860
- What's he saying?
- Something about his pal.

1055
01:31:33,900 --> 01:31:37,910
- Who's his pal?
- L don't know, maybe it's Nately.

1056
01:31:37,940 --> 01:31:39,290
Nately's dead.

1057
01:31:57,290 --> 01:32:01,390
I wouldn't go in there.
Looks like something's happened.

1058
01:32:01,420 --> 01:32:06,060
Well, l gotta go find Nately's whore.
I gotta tell her he's dead.

1059
01:32:11,480 --> 01:32:13,360
Wanna come with me?

1060
01:32:13,390 --> 01:32:17,160
Not now. l promised her
some stockings and cigarettes.

1061
01:32:17,190 --> 01:32:21,580
For her family. l know them.
First-class people.

1062
01:32:21,610 --> 01:32:25,870
- OK. l'll see you later.
- Sure.

1063
01:32:35,500 --> 01:32:39,460
- Andiamo.
- Yes, we're going. Up to my room.

1064
01:32:42,050 --> 01:32:44,550
You better get off the streets soon.

1065
01:32:44,590 --> 01:32:48,100
It's almost curfew,
you don't even have a pass.

1066
01:33:21,920 --> 01:33:26,230
- What happened?
- Gone. All gone.

1067
01:33:26,260 --> 01:33:29,300
- Who?
- All the poor young girls.

1068
01:33:29,350 --> 01:33:32,320
All gone. Taken away.

1069
01:33:33,430 --> 01:33:37,450
- Who took 'em away?
- The white-hats.

1070
01:33:37,480 --> 01:33:42,370
- The white-hats... The MPs?
- Yes, the MPs.

1071
01:33:45,280 --> 01:33:47,780
Where did they take 'em?

1072
01:33:47,820 --> 01:33:50,290
Who knows? All gone.

1073
01:33:55,540 --> 01:33:58,720
- Where's the old man?
- Gone.

1074
01:33:58,750 --> 01:34:02,180
- Gone where?
- Dead.

1075
01:34:02,210 --> 01:34:04,040
What?

1076
01:34:04,090 --> 01:34:07,930
He was alive one minute,
then he was dead.

1077
01:34:07,970 --> 01:34:11,340
- He can't be.
- Why not?

1078
01:34:19,190 --> 01:34:22,700
Where did they take the girls?
Did they arrest them?

1079
01:34:22,730 --> 01:34:26,910
I don't know.
They just came in and took them.

1080
01:34:28,610 --> 01:34:33,120
They must have had a reason.
They couldn't just drag them away.

1081
01:34:33,160 --> 01:34:35,240
No reason.

1082
01:34:37,000 --> 01:34:40,540
- What right did they have?
- Catch-22.

1083
01:34:51,890 --> 01:34:54,300
What? What did you say?

1084
01:34:54,350 --> 01:34:56,650
Catch-22.

1085
01:35:06,570 --> 01:35:09,200
How do you know it was Catch-22?

1086
01:35:09,240 --> 01:35:13,630
The girls said,
"Why are you taking us away?"

1087
01:35:13,660 --> 01:35:16,540
The men said, "Catch-22."

1088
01:35:16,580 --> 01:35:20,260
The girls said,
"What right do you have?"

1089
01:35:20,290 --> 01:35:22,930
The men said, "Catch-22."

1090
01:35:22,960 --> 01:35:27,850
All they kept saying was,
"Catch-22, Catch-22."

1091
01:35:27,880 --> 01:35:30,130
What does it mean?

1092
01:35:30,170 --> 01:35:33,600
Didn't they show you?
Didn't you ask them to read it?

1093
01:35:33,640 --> 01:35:37,860
- They don't have to show it to us.
- Who says so?

1094
01:35:37,890 --> 01:35:41,770
- The law says so.
- What law?

1095
01:35:41,810 --> 01:35:43,890
Catch-22.

1096
01:37:24,660 --> 01:37:27,160
Milo! Milo!

1097
01:37:29,420 --> 01:37:33,890
Milo, l'm gonna kill you,
you murdering son of a bitch!

1098
01:37:35,550 --> 01:37:37,220
Easy, don't hurt him.

1099
01:37:37,260 --> 01:37:40,440
I know how you feel
but it wasn't my fault.

1100
01:37:40,470 --> 01:37:42,720
- Whose fault was it?
- No one's.

1101
01:37:42,770 --> 01:37:45,890
Nately was the victim
of economic pressures,

1102
01:37:45,940 --> 01:37:50,120
- the laws of supply and demand.
- You unbelievable bastard!

1103
01:37:55,900 --> 01:37:58,830
- Do you want me to take you to her?
- Who?

1104
01:37:58,860 --> 01:38:02,070
Nately's whore,
isn't that who you're looking for?

1105
01:38:02,120 --> 01:38:05,050
- Do you know where she is?
- Of course l do.

1106
01:38:22,260 --> 01:38:26,600
You're AWOL, Yossarian.
I thought you knew better than that.

1107
01:38:26,640 --> 01:38:30,190
- Nately would never be that dumb.
- He's dead.

1108
01:38:30,230 --> 01:38:34,160
- Too bad. He was nice.
- Your boys made a nice direct hit.

1109
01:38:34,190 --> 01:38:37,290
But he died rich -
60 shares in the Syndicate.

1110
01:38:37,320 --> 01:38:40,000
- So? He's dead.
- His family'll get it.

1111
01:38:40,030 --> 01:38:43,160
- He didn't have one.
- His parents'll get it.

1112
01:38:43,200 --> 01:38:47,620
- They don't need it, they're rich.
- Then they'll understand.

1113
01:38:52,880 --> 01:38:55,130
Ask for number 33.

1114
01:39:56,610 --> 01:39:58,770
Hello, Yossarian.

1115
01:40:02,530 --> 01:40:05,500
- L didn't know.
- That l work for Milo?

1116
01:40:05,530 --> 01:40:08,000
Everybody works for Milo.

1117
01:40:08,040 --> 01:40:13,040
Yeah. Well, he told me
to ask for number 33.

1118
01:40:13,080 --> 01:40:15,470
Mm-hm. 33?

1119
01:40:20,720 --> 01:40:22,800
$10, please.

1120
01:40:29,470 --> 01:40:31,720
No towel, Yossarian?

1121
01:40:45,110 --> 01:40:48,240
- Hello, Yossarian.
- Hi, kid.

1122
01:40:54,750 --> 01:40:57,680
- Where's your sister?
- Ln there.

1123
01:40:57,710 --> 01:40:59,960
- You give me a dollar?
- Yeah.

1124
01:41:00,000 --> 01:41:03,350
- We go to America soon?
- Sure, kid.

1125
01:41:11,100 --> 01:41:13,650
- Ciao, Yossarian.
- Hi.

1126
01:41:13,680 --> 01:41:17,610
- You make love now?
- No, no. Listen.

1127
01:41:17,650 --> 01:41:21,520
- Uh, l have to tell you something.
- Nately?

1128
01:41:21,570 --> 01:41:23,290
Yeah.

1129
01:41:23,320 --> 01:41:25,210
He's coming?

1130
01:41:25,240 --> 01:41:27,320
Uh, no, not exactly.

1131
01:41:28,910 --> 01:41:33,960
- We go to America soon?
- Yeah. Listen...

1132
01:41:34,000 --> 01:41:37,040
- When we go?
- Listen...

1133
01:41:40,500 --> 01:41:42,840
Nately's dead.

1134
01:41:46,050 --> 01:41:48,940
Bruto. Bruto!

1135
01:41:50,010 --> 01:41:53,220
- T'ammazzo! T'ammazzo!
- Lt wasn't me!

1136
01:41:55,980 --> 01:41:58,200
It's not my fault!

1137
01:41:58,230 --> 01:42:01,740
- T'ammazzo!
- He was my friend, you dumb bitch!

1138
01:42:07,030 --> 01:42:11,450
T'ammazzo! T'ammazzo! T'ammazzo!

1139
01:42:21,880 --> 01:42:26,350
Assassino! Assassino!

1140
01:45:40,660 --> 01:45:44,540
- L only raped her once.
- You killed her!

1141
01:45:44,580 --> 01:45:49,300
I had to after that. She couldn't go
round saying bad things about me.

1142
01:45:49,340 --> 01:45:53,130
You dumb bastard! Why not get
some girl off the streets?

1143
01:45:53,170 --> 01:45:56,970
Oh, no, not me.
I never paid for it in my life.

1144
01:45:59,890 --> 01:46:03,760
Come on, get back!
Back up, folks.

1145
01:46:12,230 --> 01:46:16,410
Aarfy, are you insane?
They're gonna throw you in jail.

1146
01:46:17,780 --> 01:46:21,240
You just killed a girl.
She's lying in the street!

1147
01:46:21,280 --> 01:46:25,300
She has no right to be there,
you know. lt's after curfew.

1148
01:46:38,050 --> 01:46:41,180
Don't you realise what you've done?

1149
01:46:41,220 --> 01:46:44,930
You've murdered a human being!
They can hang you!

1150
01:46:44,970 --> 01:46:48,850
I don't think they'll do that,
not to good old Aarfy.

1151
01:46:48,890 --> 01:46:53,780
They won't care about one ltalian
girl when thousands die every day.

1152
01:46:53,820 --> 01:46:56,940
Aarfy, listen.
They're coming to arrest you.

1153
01:46:56,990 --> 01:47:00,950
You can't take the life of another
human and get away with it!

1154
01:47:00,990 --> 01:47:05,380
They're coming to get you!

1155
01:47:16,130 --> 01:47:18,430
- Captain Yossarian?
- Yes?

1156
01:47:18,470 --> 01:47:21,310
- You're under arrest.
- But l didn't...

1157
01:47:22,390 --> 01:47:24,610
You're AWOL.

1158
01:47:29,140 --> 01:47:32,070
'We're sending you home.'
'What?'

1159
01:47:33,770 --> 01:47:36,410
l said we're sending you home.

1160
01:47:36,440 --> 01:47:41,450
You've made things terribly
difficult for Colonel Cathcart.

1161
01:47:41,490 --> 01:47:45,670
The men are unhappy,
morale is beginning to deteriorate.

1162
01:47:45,700 --> 01:47:49,710
- Lt's all your fault.
- Lt's his, for raising the number.

1163
01:47:49,750 --> 01:47:53,800
- You refuse to fly.
- Have you no patriotism?

1164
01:47:53,830 --> 01:47:58,250
Wouldn't you give your life for your
country? For Colonel Korn and me?

1165
01:47:58,300 --> 01:48:01,810
What have you and Colonel Korn
got to do with my country?

1166
01:48:01,840 --> 01:48:06,260
You're a disgrace to your country!
How did you get to be a captain?

1167
01:48:06,310 --> 01:48:10,690
- You promoted me.
- That has got nothing to do with it!

1168
01:48:10,730 --> 01:48:13,740
Let me. Let me.

1169
01:48:13,770 --> 01:48:19,020
Captain, l'd like to appeal to
your better judgment one more time.

1170
01:48:19,070 --> 01:48:23,400
There's a mission about to start.
You can get on that plane

1171
01:48:23,450 --> 01:48:27,380
and we'll just pretend
that all of this never happened.

1172
01:48:27,410 --> 01:48:32,550
Yossarian, won't it make you feel
proud to know you served in an outfit

1173
01:48:32,580 --> 01:48:37,000
that averaged more combat missions
per person than any other?

1174
01:48:37,040 --> 01:48:39,460
Don't you want more unit citations

1175
01:48:39,510 --> 01:48:42,770
and more oak-leaf clusters
on your Air Medal?

1176
01:48:42,800 --> 01:48:46,900
Don't you want to contribute
further to this fleet record

1177
01:48:46,930 --> 01:48:49,230
by flying more missions?

1178
01:48:49,270 --> 01:48:50,860
No.

1179
01:48:51,930 --> 01:48:56,600
In that case,
we'll just have to send you home.

1180
01:48:56,650 --> 01:48:59,200
Of course, there's one catch.

1181
01:49:00,530 --> 01:49:02,410
Yeah? What's that?

1182
01:49:03,530 --> 01:49:08,280
Well, we will issue orders
sending you back to the States

1183
01:49:08,330 --> 01:49:12,880
and there's one thing
you have to do for us in return.

1184
01:49:12,910 --> 01:49:15,220
What would that be?

1185
01:49:23,720 --> 01:49:26,100
Like us.

1186
01:49:42,490 --> 01:49:45,070
Like you?

1187
01:49:46,360 --> 01:49:48,250
Like us.

1188
01:49:48,280 --> 01:49:52,160
You'll be surprised how easy it is
to like us once you begin.

1189
01:49:52,200 --> 01:49:55,470
You see, we're going to put you
on Easy Street.

1190
01:49:55,500 --> 01:49:59,640
- Make you a major.
- Give you another medal.

1191
01:49:59,670 --> 01:50:03,720
- Send you home a hero.
- You'll have parades in your honour.

1192
01:50:03,760 --> 01:50:07,270
You can make speeches,
raise money for war bonds.

1193
01:50:07,300 --> 01:50:10,680
And all you have to do
is be our pal.

1194
01:50:10,720 --> 01:50:13,360
Say nice things about us.

1195
01:50:13,390 --> 01:50:17,730
Tell the folks at home
what a good job we're doing.

1196
01:50:21,570 --> 01:50:24,120
Take our offer, Yossarian.

1197
01:50:24,150 --> 01:50:28,650
It's either that
or a court martial for desertion.

1198
01:50:35,830 --> 01:50:40,580
What about the others?
L'd be playing a dirty trick on them.

1199
01:50:40,630 --> 01:50:45,710
- They'll be happy you're gone.
- They have a war to win.

1200
01:50:50,510 --> 01:50:52,590
Well, what the hell.

1201
01:50:52,640 --> 01:50:56,100
If they don't want more missions,
let them say so.

1202
01:50:56,140 --> 01:50:59,570
- Precisely.
- Exactly.

1203
01:51:03,230 --> 01:51:05,540
It's a deal.

1204
01:51:44,230 --> 01:51:46,480
Assassino!

1205
01:51:56,870 --> 01:51:59,550
Help! Help!

1206
01:52:23,730 --> 01:52:25,320
'Help him!'

1207
01:52:25,360 --> 01:52:28,240
- What?
- 'Help him! Help him!'

1208
01:52:28,280 --> 01:52:30,910
- Help who?
- 'Help the bombardier!'

1209
01:52:30,950 --> 01:52:35,450
- l'm the bombardier, l'm all right.
- 'Then help him! Help HlM!'

1210
01:52:48,170 --> 01:52:50,420
l'm cold.

1211
01:52:50,460 --> 01:52:53,140
Cold. God.

1212
01:52:53,180 --> 01:52:57,900
It's gonna be OK, kid.
We'll be home soon.

1213
01:53:09,360 --> 01:53:12,450
- Does the leg still hurt?
- No.

1214
01:53:43,560 --> 01:53:45,780
There, there.

1215
01:53:53,940 --> 01:53:56,030
There, there.

1216
01:53:58,200 --> 01:54:00,280
There, there.

1217
01:54:27,480 --> 01:54:30,690
- May we come in?
- Sure.

1218
01:54:30,730 --> 01:54:33,490
- L see you're all alone.
- Yep.

1219
01:54:33,530 --> 01:54:35,830
Well, you're going home.

1220
01:54:38,070 --> 01:54:41,840
- L don't know if l am.
- L've got your orders right here.

1221
01:54:41,870 --> 01:54:46,130
That parade they're rehearsing
is for you. You're a hero.

1222
01:54:46,160 --> 01:54:51,080
And you're gonna get a medal for
stopping that Nazi killing Cathcart.

1223
01:54:51,130 --> 01:54:55,520
That wasn't a Nazi.
That was Nately's whore.

1224
01:54:55,550 --> 01:54:59,600
She tried to kill me
because l told her about Nately.

1225
01:55:01,470 --> 01:55:05,970
- But-but the Colonel said that...
- lt's a deal l made with them.

1226
01:55:06,020 --> 01:55:07,930
They send me home a hero

1227
01:55:07,980 --> 01:55:11,990
and l say wonderful things
about them back in the States.

1228
01:55:16,240 --> 01:55:18,320
Oh.

1229
01:55:20,280 --> 01:55:22,780
That's a lousy deal, isn't it?

1230
01:55:25,040 --> 01:55:28,330
- Lsn't it?
- Well...

1231
01:55:31,420 --> 01:55:33,830
lsn't it?

1232
01:55:33,880 --> 01:55:37,090
I don't know,
l'm not here to judge you.

1233
01:55:37,130 --> 01:55:39,350
What are you here for?

1234
01:55:41,090 --> 01:55:43,650
I'm not too sure about that either.

1235
01:55:45,600 --> 01:55:48,020
What would you do if you were me?

1236
01:55:50,140 --> 01:55:53,690
I don't know. l mean, l'm not you.

1237
01:55:55,520 --> 01:55:57,830
Imagine that you are me.

1238
01:56:00,110 --> 01:56:05,540
That's hard. Sometimes l even have
trouble imagining that l'm me,

1239
01:56:05,580 --> 01:56:07,660
if you know what l mean.

1240
01:56:11,540 --> 01:56:13,870
Well, l'm gonna call the deal off.

1241
01:56:13,920 --> 01:56:18,010
Let them send me home
because l've flown over 50 missions.

1242
01:56:18,050 --> 01:56:21,840
- They'd have to send home every man.
- That's their problem.

1243
01:56:21,880 --> 01:56:25,560
No, it's yours because
they'll court-martial you.

1244
01:56:25,600 --> 01:56:28,940
- Make the best of a bad situation.
- No.

1245
01:56:28,970 --> 01:56:31,060
No what?

1246
01:56:32,810 --> 01:56:37,150
L've been lying in this bed
for three weeks thinking about it

1247
01:56:37,190 --> 01:56:40,700
and all l know is
l don't want to go to prison

1248
01:56:40,740 --> 01:56:43,290
and l can't play Cathcart's game.

1249
01:56:45,030 --> 01:56:48,580
Well, what else can you do?

1250
01:56:48,620 --> 01:56:51,120
I can run away.

1251
01:56:52,210 --> 01:56:54,590
- You'd desert?
- Why not?

1252
01:56:54,630 --> 01:56:57,720
How would you get off the base?
That's insane.

1253
01:56:57,750 --> 01:57:00,140
That's why it's so sensible.

1254
01:57:00,170 --> 01:57:03,350
They'll call you a coward.
It's your country.

1255
01:57:03,380 --> 01:57:07,230
Christ, l've flown 55 missions
and fought three years,

1256
01:57:07,260 --> 01:57:09,260
now l'll fight for myself.

1257
01:57:09,310 --> 01:57:13,810
- Suppose everyone felt that way?
- L'd be a fool to feel different.

1258
01:57:13,850 --> 01:57:16,440
What would your friends say?

1259
01:57:16,480 --> 01:57:20,620
I haven't got any.
Nately was blown to bits,

1260
01:57:20,650 --> 01:57:23,150
McWatt killed himself,

1261
01:57:23,200 --> 01:57:27,830
Hungry Joe was chopped in two,
Dobbs disappeared,

1262
01:57:27,870 --> 01:57:30,370
Aardvark's a murderer,

1263
01:57:30,410 --> 01:57:33,050
Doc Daneeka's a zombie...

1264
01:57:34,790 --> 01:57:36,870
They're all gone.

1265
01:57:37,130 --> 01:57:41,220
The only friend l had was Snowden
and l didn't even know him.

1266
01:57:41,260 --> 01:57:43,890
What about Orr?

1267
01:57:43,920 --> 01:57:46,310
Orr's at the bottom of the sea.

1268
01:57:46,340 --> 01:57:49,020
No, he isn't. Don't you know?

1269
01:57:49,060 --> 01:57:51,640
- Know what?
- Orr's in Sweden.

1270
01:57:51,680 --> 01:57:53,570
What?

1271
01:57:53,600 --> 01:57:58,190
After 16 weeks at sea, Orr was found
by a trio of Swedish Girl Scouts.

1272
01:57:58,230 --> 01:58:01,080
- Lt's a miracle.
- He rowed all the way.

1273
01:58:01,110 --> 01:58:03,830
- He rowed?
- Ln that tiny little raft!

1274
01:58:03,860 --> 01:58:06,360
Think of that, all the way to Sweden!

1275
01:58:06,410 --> 01:58:09,450
- He'll sit out the rest of the war.
- Lt's a miracle!

1276
01:58:09,490 --> 01:58:12,620
It's no miracle.
He has to have planned it.

1277
01:58:12,660 --> 01:58:16,800
- He went to Sweden deliberately?
- Lt's 4,000 miles away!

1278
01:58:16,830 --> 01:58:20,850
He always said that
crash-landing was good practice.

1279
01:58:20,880 --> 01:58:25,350
- Getting shot down in the sea.
- On every mission that he flew!

1280
01:58:27,180 --> 01:58:29,310
No, no, no. That is a miracle.

1281
01:58:30,600 --> 01:58:35,680
Practicing
getting shot down in the sea!

1282
01:58:35,730 --> 01:58:37,950
He made it?

1283
01:58:39,770 --> 01:58:41,940
He made it?

1284
01:58:43,650 --> 01:58:48,370
He made it!
That son of a bitch made it!

1285
01:58:59,540 --> 01:59:04,290
- Are you crazy? ls he crazy?
- Lf he made it, so can l!

1286
01:59:04,340 --> 01:59:07,630
- We gotta stop him.
- L can do it, Danby!

1287
01:59:07,680 --> 01:59:10,480
- They'll catch you!
- L can do it!

1288
01:59:10,510 --> 01:59:12,930
- This is insane!
- L can do it!

1289
01:59:12,970 --> 01:59:16,350
- But your clothes!
- They'll never recognise me.

1290
01:59:16,390 --> 01:59:20,100
You'll be on the run,
in constant danger of betrayal!

1291
01:59:20,150 --> 01:59:22,620
I live that way now.

1292
01:59:22,650 --> 01:59:26,240
- For God's sake, hurry up!
- So long, Chaplain.

1293
01:59:26,280 --> 01:59:30,920
- How do you feel, Yossarian?
- Fine, except l'm scared to death.

1294
01:59:30,950 --> 01:59:34,240
- You'll have to keep on your toes!
- L will.

1295
01:59:34,290 --> 01:59:36,420
- You'll have to jump.
- L'll jump.

1296
01:59:36,450 --> 01:59:38,420
Jump!

1296
01:59:39,305 --> 01:59:45,353
