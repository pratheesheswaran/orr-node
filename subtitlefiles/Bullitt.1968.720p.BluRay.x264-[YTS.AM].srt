1
00:03:15,070 --> 00:03:17,154
- This is Pete.
- Yeah?

2
00:03:19,533 --> 00:03:20,700
We lost him.

3
00:03:21,535 --> 00:03:25,872
He's your brother, Ross. If you can't
find him, we have people who will.

4
00:03:26,874 --> 00:03:29,333
And you're paying for the contract.

5
00:04:44,660 --> 00:04:47,328
Excuse me.
Have you got a message for Mr. Ross?

6
00:04:47,496 --> 00:04:48,996
What room, sir?

7
00:04:49,247 --> 00:04:50,456
I'm not a guest.

8
00:04:50,624 --> 00:04:52,416
- I'll check.
- Thanks.

9
00:04:58,882 --> 00:05:01,384
- That's Johnny Ross.
- Yes, sir.

10
00:05:05,514 --> 00:05:07,056
Sorry, sir, nothing.

11
00:05:07,516 --> 00:05:08,808
Nothing?

12
00:05:09,059 --> 00:05:11,435
- Are you sure?
- I'm sure, sir.

13
00:05:14,439 --> 00:05:15,940
Okay, thanks.

14
00:05:37,504 --> 00:05:38,838
Thank you.

15
00:05:56,773 --> 00:05:58,816
Yes, I'm sure it was him.

16
00:05:59,317 --> 00:06:01,944
Sunshine Cab, 6912.

17
00:06:09,786 --> 00:06:13,122
- Would you pull up? I want to make a call.
- Right.

18
00:07:13,683 --> 00:07:14,850
Yeah?

19
00:07:15,102 --> 00:07:16,435
Delgetti.

20
00:07:16,937 --> 00:07:18,938
- What is it?
- Work.

21
00:07:21,525 --> 00:07:23,526
Frank, let me in, will you?

22
00:07:53,932 --> 00:07:57,101
What time did you get to bed
this morning, Frank?

23
00:07:57,894 --> 00:07:59,311
About 5.

24
00:08:15,579 --> 00:08:17,413
"Mumps vaccine on the market."

25
00:08:17,581 --> 00:08:19,373
"The government authorized yesterday..."

26
00:08:19,541 --> 00:08:23,460
"...what officials term the first clearly
effective vaccine to prevent mumps."

27
00:08:26,756 --> 00:08:30,092
"...Announced it has granted
a license for the vaccine..."

28
00:08:35,432 --> 00:08:37,600
"at 12:45, Wednesday..."

29
00:08:37,767 --> 00:08:41,937
Why don't you just relax, have
your orange juice, and shut up, Delgetti?

30
00:08:45,942 --> 00:08:47,610
Let's go, Frank.

31
00:09:49,714 --> 00:09:52,007
Lt. Bullitt to see you, Mr. Chalmers.

32
00:09:53,510 --> 00:09:55,970
Conditions in our local politics here.

33
00:09:56,137 --> 00:09:57,972
It was purely unintentional, I assure you.

34
00:09:58,139 --> 00:10:02,017
It wasn't that I was so well-informed,
it was just that he was so ill-informed.

35
00:10:02,185 --> 00:10:04,395
Would you excuse me
for a moment, please?

36
00:10:11,194 --> 00:10:12,987
What do you like about...?

37
00:10:13,154 --> 00:10:17,199
In Orinda, we have all this beautiful
dry sunshine. Absolutely perfect for roses.

38
00:10:17,367 --> 00:10:20,202
I do all my own work.
You should see my hands from pruning.

39
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:23,539
Hello. Lieutenant, how are you?

40
00:10:25,208 --> 00:10:27,793
Thanks for coming over.
The name is Frank, isn't it?

41
00:10:27,961 --> 00:10:30,212
- That's right.
- Please call me Walter.

42
00:10:34,467 --> 00:10:38,345
I have an important job for you.
Capt. Bennet suggested that you take it.

43
00:10:38,513 --> 00:10:42,099
As you know, there is a senate
subcommittee hearing here Monday.

44
00:10:42,392 --> 00:10:45,060
I have a star witness
who needs protection.

45
00:10:45,228 --> 00:10:47,771
Sam said that
you were the man for the job.

46
00:10:48,398 --> 00:10:50,858
And I can't find a flaw in that statement.

47
00:10:51,026 --> 00:10:52,776
Protection from who?

48
00:10:54,154 --> 00:10:55,779
The Organization.

49
00:10:55,947 --> 00:10:59,241
His name is Ross.
Johnny Ross from Chicago.

50
00:11:00,577 --> 00:11:04,246
Once and for all, the top men
in law enforcement are united.

51
00:11:04,414 --> 00:11:06,874
We're going to expose the Organization.

52
00:11:07,042 --> 00:11:10,252
I read your speech. Why San Francisco?

53
00:11:10,837 --> 00:11:13,756
Ross is safer here. That's your province.

54
00:11:14,424 --> 00:11:16,717
Keeping him out of reach for 40 hours.

55
00:11:16,885 --> 00:11:18,093
Where?

56
00:11:18,261 --> 00:11:22,765
The Hotel Daniels.
226 Embarcadero Road. Room 634.

57
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:25,809
He's there now, expecting you.

58
00:11:27,604 --> 00:11:29,563
Now that you know where my house is...

59
00:11:29,731 --> 00:11:32,649
...I hope that we'll get to see
a lot more of each other.

60
00:11:32,817 --> 00:11:35,319
Particularly in view of the investigation.

61
00:11:35,487 --> 00:11:37,363
A senatorial hearing has a way of...

62
00:11:37,530 --> 00:11:40,699
...catapulting everyone involved
into the public eye...

63
00:11:40,867 --> 00:11:43,786
...with a subsequent
effect on one's career.

64
00:11:44,788 --> 00:11:47,456
It will be a pleasure to have you along.

65
00:11:48,708 --> 00:11:51,251
Have him in court on Monday, Frank.

66
00:12:06,226 --> 00:12:08,519
- What was that all about?
- Pals.

67
00:12:08,686 --> 00:12:11,480
You and Chalmers? That's a lot of juice.

68
00:12:11,648 --> 00:12:13,774
Hotel Daniels, 226 Embarcadero Road.

69
00:12:13,942 --> 00:12:16,485
State's evidence witness,
we're babysitting. Let's go.

70
00:12:16,653 --> 00:12:18,695
- You got any coffee?
- Yeah.

71
00:13:08,872 --> 00:13:10,247
- Yeah, who is it?
- Police.

72
00:13:10,415 --> 00:13:12,207
The roof and the exits.

73
00:13:22,886 --> 00:13:26,138
Mr. Chalmers said you'd be here by 5: 00.
He guaranteed me that.

74
00:13:26,306 --> 00:13:28,599
Sorry, we got held up in traffic.

75
00:13:29,726 --> 00:13:31,393
Got any firearms?

76
00:13:31,728 --> 00:13:36,231
No, man, I got nothing on me.
Just my wallet, cigarette lighter.

77
00:13:37,108 --> 00:13:38,484
Want to check me out yourself?

78
00:13:38,651 --> 00:13:42,613
No, that's not necessary. Put that
stuff on the bed, will you, please?

79
00:13:45,742 --> 00:13:48,410
How did you get here from Chicago?

80
00:13:48,953 --> 00:13:50,412
I flew.

81
00:13:51,706 --> 00:13:54,958
Sure none of the boys were on the plane
with you, or saw you get on?

82
00:13:55,126 --> 00:13:56,960
How would I know? I wouldn't know.

83
00:13:57,128 --> 00:13:58,921
Why did you pick this room to hole up?

84
00:13:59,088 --> 00:14:01,381
I didn't pick it. Chalmers picked it.

85
00:14:01,549 --> 00:14:02,591
Why?

86
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:05,636
Stay away from those windows.
That's why.

87
00:14:10,183 --> 00:14:11,266
Say, look...

88
00:14:11,434 --> 00:14:14,728
Sit down and relax, Ross.
It's a long wait until Monday morning.

89
00:14:14,938 --> 00:14:16,939
We'd better get a fix on some food.

90
00:14:17,106 --> 00:14:19,107
- What?
- Some food.

91
00:14:20,109 --> 00:14:23,403
I know Chalmers wants you to be happy.
We'll do the best we can.

92
00:14:23,780 --> 00:14:24,821
Dad, it's for you.

93
00:14:24,989 --> 00:14:28,992
Listen, you're not going.
We're going to a movie.

94
00:14:30,662 --> 00:14:33,539
Hold it down. Don't be too late.

95
00:14:35,291 --> 00:14:37,084
- Hello.
- Hello. Captain?

96
00:14:37,252 --> 00:14:39,628
- Frank?
- We'll see you later, Dad.

97
00:14:39,963 --> 00:14:41,588
I've seen Chalmers.

98
00:14:42,131 --> 00:14:45,175
- What do you know about Ross?
- Chicago. It could be very big.

99
00:14:45,343 --> 00:14:49,304
He had access to all the records. He ran
the wire services with his brother, Pete.

100
00:14:49,472 --> 00:14:50,764
Did Chalmers ask for me?

101
00:14:53,601 --> 00:14:54,893
Do you happen to know why?

102
00:14:55,270 --> 00:14:58,313
Yes, I know why.
He's grooming himself for public office.

103
00:14:58,982 --> 00:15:02,109
You make good copy.
They love you in the papers, Frank.

104
00:15:02,277 --> 00:15:03,652
I see.

105
00:15:03,987 --> 00:15:06,196
Okay. So long, Sam.

106
00:15:07,323 --> 00:15:10,951
Say, who were you talking to about me
on that telephone?

107
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:13,745
Mr. Chalmers said
this was just between me and him.

108
00:15:13,913 --> 00:15:15,998
Me and him, man, that's all.

109
00:15:17,292 --> 00:15:21,044
Delgetti will take the first shift,
Stanton at 12: 00. I'll take the third.

110
00:15:21,212 --> 00:15:24,006
All you got to worry about
is staying away from the windows.

111
00:15:24,173 --> 00:15:26,592
Especially at night.
You call me before you leave.

112
00:15:26,759 --> 00:15:28,176
Excuse me.

113
00:15:40,231 --> 00:15:42,357
Fire escape and the freeway.

114
00:15:42,859 --> 00:15:45,569
- Bad news, right?
- Right. Want me to stay?

115
00:15:45,737 --> 00:15:47,446
No. Go on home to your wife.

116
00:15:47,614 --> 00:15:49,448
- What shift?
- Second.

117
00:15:49,616 --> 00:15:52,659
If we work on the weekend,
we get two days off?

118
00:15:53,578 --> 00:15:54,870
So long.

119
00:16:08,092 --> 00:16:09,593
- Hi.
- Hi.

120
00:16:16,934 --> 00:16:18,935
Is this the new fountain?

121
00:16:20,563 --> 00:16:24,066
Fountain? All the client can afford
is a leaky faucet.

122
00:16:25,068 --> 00:16:28,236
I thought that money didn't matter
to artists.

123
00:16:28,613 --> 00:16:31,031
It costs money to have a soul.

124
00:16:32,075 --> 00:16:35,327
"Friction loss of water in feet
per hundred feet. Length of pipe..."

125
00:16:35,495 --> 00:16:39,373
"Formula using constant one-hundred size
of standard pipe in inches."

126
00:16:39,540 --> 00:16:41,708
I want to use
600 gallons of water per minute.

127
00:16:41,876 --> 00:16:45,420
Now, what's the velocity per second
of a 5-inch pipe?

128
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:52,636
Look to the extreme right.

129
00:16:52,804 --> 00:16:55,639
Now go down the figures
until you find 600.

130
00:16:58,309 --> 00:16:59,351
Got it.

131
00:16:59,519 --> 00:17:02,646
Now go across
until you find the 5-inch-pipe column.

132
00:17:03,314 --> 00:17:05,440
- What does it say?
- 9.8.

133
00:17:06,067 --> 00:17:08,235
Now I want the loss in feet.

134
00:17:10,780 --> 00:17:11,947
Feet?

135
00:17:14,492 --> 00:17:15,534
Well?

136
00:17:15,702 --> 00:17:18,620
I lost my place. Nobody's perfect.

137
00:17:26,087 --> 00:17:29,840
- May I use your phone, please?
- Good evening. It's right this way.

138
00:17:32,802 --> 00:17:34,803
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

139
00:17:39,308 --> 00:17:40,976
- Yeah?
- Del?

140
00:17:41,644 --> 00:17:45,147
Coffee Cantata. 931-0770.

141
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:48,191
- 931-0770.
- Right.

142
00:17:49,193 --> 00:17:52,821
If a Sgt. Delgetti calls me,
would you please let me know right away?

143
00:17:52,989 --> 00:17:54,990
- I certainly will.
- Thank you.

144
00:19:48,980 --> 00:19:50,647
- Yes?
- Del. I'm coming off now.

145
00:19:51,065 --> 00:19:53,275
- Everything okay?
- Yeah, sure.

146
00:19:55,069 --> 00:19:56,945
Hold it down, will you?

147
00:19:57,613 --> 00:19:58,989
I'm sorry.

148
00:20:06,455 --> 00:20:09,749
- Anything for Stanton?
- No, I'll see you tomorrow.

149
00:20:25,474 --> 00:20:26,975
Who was it?

150
00:20:32,982 --> 00:20:34,900
Something exciting?

151
00:20:35,151 --> 00:20:36,651
Go to sleep.

152
00:20:37,653 --> 00:20:40,155
Meaning you won't tell me anything.

153
00:20:41,657 --> 00:20:43,742
It's not for you, baby.

154
00:20:46,996 --> 00:20:49,331
Anything you do is part of me.

155
00:21:41,634 --> 00:21:44,886
Front desk. Two gentlemen.
Shall I send them up?

156
00:21:45,680 --> 00:21:48,348
- What are their names?
- Hold on a minute.

157
00:21:51,310 --> 00:21:53,395
Mr. Chalmers and a friend.

158
00:21:57,233 --> 00:22:00,652
Listen, tell them to wait.
And give me 421-7596.

159
00:22:12,748 --> 00:22:14,124
- Frank?
- Yeah.

160
00:22:14,291 --> 00:22:17,293
Chalmers is downstairs with another man.
They want to come up.

161
00:22:18,671 --> 00:22:22,298
Chalmers, at 1:00 a.m.? Don't let them in.
I'll be there in five minutes.

162
00:22:22,466 --> 00:22:23,842
All right.

163
00:22:24,093 --> 00:22:25,927
Please, away from the door.

164
00:22:26,095 --> 00:22:28,138
Here are the latest
baseball scores, just in.

165
00:22:28,305 --> 00:22:30,473
In the National League,
San Francisco Giants...

166
00:22:30,641 --> 00:22:32,892
...beat the Dodgers in both ends
of a double-header.

167
00:22:33,060 --> 00:22:36,855
A 2-0 shutout in the twilighter,
and a 4-1 win in the nightcap.

168
00:22:52,455 --> 00:22:53,955
No, wait.

169
00:22:54,457 --> 00:22:55,874
Now look.

170
00:22:58,252 --> 00:22:59,753
He told me...

171
00:24:00,022 --> 00:24:01,856
Holy mackerel!

172
00:24:13,702 --> 00:24:16,579
- Who is it?
- Ross. Two guys got him with a shotgun.

173
00:24:16,747 --> 00:24:17,747
And Stanton?

174
00:24:17,915 --> 00:24:20,208
They got him in the leg.
They're bringing him down.

175
00:24:20,376 --> 00:24:22,043
Stick with Ross. Barney.

176
00:24:22,211 --> 00:24:24,879
As soon as the lab men
get out of 634, seal it.

177
00:24:25,047 --> 00:24:27,298
- But seal it, Barney.
- Yes, sir.

178
00:25:27,526 --> 00:25:30,195
- How bad?
- Bad. He's got a bleeder.

179
00:25:46,253 --> 00:25:47,879
The door is not open.

180
00:25:48,297 --> 00:25:50,965
Somebody screwed up.
The door's not open.

181
00:25:51,133 --> 00:25:52,800
Somebody put the bed in.

182
00:26:19,745 --> 00:26:21,788
I know you're hurting...

183
00:26:21,956 --> 00:26:23,957
...but I've got to know now.

184
00:26:24,166 --> 00:26:26,834
The two men. Do you remember anything?

185
00:26:29,505 --> 00:26:30,922
Caucasian.

186
00:26:32,007 --> 00:26:35,343
The one who fired, about 5' 10".
White hair.

187
00:26:36,929 --> 00:26:38,763
Gun, Winchester pump.

188
00:26:40,349 --> 00:26:42,767
All I remember. Came in so fast.

189
00:26:47,022 --> 00:26:49,857
Chain was off. He unlocked the door.

190
00:26:50,025 --> 00:26:51,192
Who unlocked it?

191
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:53,987
Ross. Like he was expecting someone.

192
00:26:56,031 --> 00:26:57,615
How is my leg?

193
00:26:58,367 --> 00:27:01,536
Hold on, Carl,
we'll be there in a couple of minutes.

194
00:27:30,899 --> 00:27:32,692
Get out of the way.

195
00:27:35,863 --> 00:27:37,363
To the right.

196
00:27:45,706 --> 00:27:47,081
Let's go.

197
00:27:50,461 --> 00:27:51,919
Scissors, Jones.

198
00:27:53,589 --> 00:27:56,007
Somebody get the blood pressure.

199
00:27:56,425 --> 00:27:57,675
Oxygen.

200
00:28:00,471 --> 00:28:02,430
Can I have an ABD pad?

201
00:28:07,019 --> 00:28:10,229
Can you move your hand?
Do you want to step out?

202
00:28:10,397 --> 00:28:13,107
Your buddy's all right.
His leg's gonna be okay.

203
00:28:13,275 --> 00:28:15,068
Somebody get x-rays.

204
00:28:17,988 --> 00:28:19,238
How's Stanton?

205
00:28:19,406 --> 00:28:22,408
He'll be all right, but
he's busted up. Ross?

206
00:28:22,576 --> 00:28:24,369
I don't know, Frank.

207
00:28:25,162 --> 00:28:28,206
You better call Stanton's wife
and get her over here.

208
00:28:28,374 --> 00:28:29,499
Okay.

209
00:28:34,838 --> 00:28:38,883
Intercostal vessels, move them away.
Suture ligature.

210
00:28:39,635 --> 00:28:41,260
- Here you go.
- What is it?

211
00:28:41,428 --> 00:28:42,595
3-0.

212
00:28:42,763 --> 00:28:45,640
- What's his blood pressure now?
- Scissors.

213
00:28:46,725 --> 00:28:50,144
It's down to 90 over 70.
Started the blood line.

214
00:28:53,399 --> 00:28:54,690
Suture.

215
00:28:55,150 --> 00:28:56,192
Kelly.

216
00:28:57,694 --> 00:28:59,028
Scissors.

217
00:29:00,989 --> 00:29:03,324
- Better let me tie this one.
- Okay.

218
00:29:07,496 --> 00:29:09,288
Get some balm, please.

219
00:29:10,958 --> 00:29:12,125
Here you go.

220
00:29:12,292 --> 00:29:15,711
He's dropping. Pulse is also going up now.

221
00:29:17,840 --> 00:29:19,549
What was it pre-op?

222
00:29:20,300 --> 00:29:23,302
- BP pre-op was 140 over 90.
- Kahn, take this.

223
00:29:23,470 --> 00:29:26,013
- Now it's 90 over 70.
- How much blood do you have?

224
00:29:26,181 --> 00:29:29,350
We have four up here,
and we've ordered four more units.

225
00:29:30,561 --> 00:29:32,353
How much have you given him?

226
00:29:32,521 --> 00:29:36,691
- We're starting the first one right now.
- You'd better bring me another one.

227
00:29:37,443 --> 00:29:38,943
Mayo, please.

228
00:29:45,951 --> 00:29:49,370
- This is the subclavian.
- Here's your wipe, doctor.

229
00:29:49,913 --> 00:29:51,622
Thank you, Deanne.

230
00:29:57,129 --> 00:29:59,046
- 2-0 Dermalon.
- Yes, sir.

231
00:30:04,470 --> 00:30:07,388
- What are his chances?
- No more than fifty-fifty.

232
00:30:07,556 --> 00:30:11,184
We stopped the hemorrhaging, but they
got some of the major blood vessels.

233
00:30:11,351 --> 00:30:12,894
Thank you, doctor.

234
00:31:22,130 --> 00:31:24,298
- How is he doing?
- Holding.

235
00:31:25,092 --> 00:31:27,885
- Stanton?
- Okay. He's sleeping now.

236
00:31:28,679 --> 00:31:30,555
I want to talk to you.

237
00:31:40,941 --> 00:31:42,817
I got the report back from the lab.

238
00:31:42,985 --> 00:31:45,486
Nothing at the hotel.
How come they got in?

239
00:31:45,654 --> 00:31:49,240
Ross got to the door,
unhooked the chain from the inside.

240
00:31:50,325 --> 00:31:54,495
He let the killers in himself?
Why would he do a thing like that?

241
00:31:55,330 --> 00:31:57,415
I'm waiting to ask him.

242
00:31:58,166 --> 00:32:00,668
What about the setup?
What do you think about that?

243
00:32:00,836 --> 00:32:03,629
Shotgun and a backup man. Professionals.

244
00:32:04,423 --> 00:32:05,631
Yep.

245
00:32:15,142 --> 00:32:17,101
I had to call Chalmers.

246
00:32:18,478 --> 00:32:19,520
And?

247
00:32:19,688 --> 00:32:22,356
It didn't go down too good.
It's the main event for him.

248
00:32:22,524 --> 00:32:24,650
You know,
the senate subcommittee hearing.

249
00:32:24,818 --> 00:32:27,361
He can't produce the big surprise
he promised everyone.

250
00:32:27,529 --> 00:32:30,865
He may try to make up some mileage
by laying it on us.

251
00:32:32,242 --> 00:32:34,619
Play it by the book from now on.

252
00:32:36,163 --> 00:32:38,497
Does Chalmers run this case, or do I?

253
00:32:38,665 --> 00:32:41,042
All I'm interested in is results.

254
00:32:41,209 --> 00:32:43,502
Do whatever you think is best.

255
00:32:46,506 --> 00:32:48,549
I'll try to back you up.

256
00:33:05,275 --> 00:33:08,569
Excuse me, sir.
Are you the policeman who hasn't eaten?

257
00:33:08,737 --> 00:33:10,112
Yes, ma'am.

258
00:33:10,572 --> 00:33:12,281
- Thank you.
- Surely.

259
00:33:37,391 --> 00:33:38,849
Where is he?

260
00:34:00,789 --> 00:34:02,081
How is he, doctor?

261
00:34:02,249 --> 00:34:05,626
As well as can be expected.
He's still under the anesthesia.

262
00:34:05,794 --> 00:34:06,794
I'm Walter Chalmers.

263
00:34:06,962 --> 00:34:10,715
Is there any possibility of my getting
a deposition from Ross before Monday?

264
00:34:10,882 --> 00:34:14,844
That's impossible to say at this time.
He may remain in shock.

265
00:34:15,929 --> 00:34:18,764
I thank you for doing all you can, doctor.

266
00:34:21,852 --> 00:34:23,644
Get the supervisor.

267
00:34:34,072 --> 00:34:36,615
Now, what went wrong, lieutenant?

268
00:34:37,325 --> 00:34:39,952
- Who else knew where he was?
- What?

269
00:34:41,079 --> 00:34:43,122
Who else knew where he was?

270
00:34:43,915 --> 00:34:45,750
What are you implying?

271
00:34:45,917 --> 00:34:49,962
They knew where to look for him,
and they used your name to get in.

272
00:34:52,174 --> 00:34:55,384
Are you suggesting
I disclosed his whereabouts?

273
00:34:55,594 --> 00:34:59,013
Somebody did. And it didn't come from us.

274
00:34:59,931 --> 00:35:02,016
That's hardly the issue.

275
00:35:03,477 --> 00:35:05,519
Well, it certainly is.

276
00:35:06,980 --> 00:35:09,648
I've got an officer with a family.

277
00:35:11,109 --> 00:35:13,360
And he's shot up pretty bad.

278
00:35:14,780 --> 00:35:17,364
And I've got a witness who can't talk.

279
00:35:18,450 --> 00:35:21,994
I want to know about Ross.
What was the deal you made with him?

280
00:35:22,162 --> 00:35:23,287
Deal?

281
00:35:25,457 --> 00:35:28,834
Lieutenant, don't try to evade
the responsibility.

282
00:35:29,336 --> 00:35:32,171
In your parlance, you blew it.

283
00:35:33,215 --> 00:35:35,216
You knew the significance
of his testimony.

284
00:35:35,383 --> 00:35:38,886
Yet you failed to take
adequate measures to protect him.

285
00:35:39,054 --> 00:35:41,639
So to you it was a job. No more.

286
00:35:42,766 --> 00:35:47,311
Were it more, and you had the dedication
I was led to believe...

287
00:35:48,021 --> 00:35:50,022
You believe what you want.

288
00:35:50,190 --> 00:35:53,692
You work your side of the street,
and I'll work mine.

289
00:35:57,906 --> 00:36:01,617
Lieutenant, I shall personally officiate
at your public crucifixion...

290
00:36:01,785 --> 00:36:04,578
...if Ross doesn't recover
during the course of the hearing...

291
00:36:04,746 --> 00:36:06,997
...so I can at least
present his deposition.

292
00:36:07,165 --> 00:36:11,752
And I assure you, I shall not suffer
the consequence of your incompetence.

293
00:36:12,045 --> 00:36:14,380
And even if there wasn't any...

294
00:36:15,048 --> 00:36:18,592
...I'm rather certain
I can prove negligence on your part.

295
00:36:23,723 --> 00:36:25,766
There may be another attempt on his life.

296
00:36:25,934 --> 00:36:29,311
I'll be back in the morning,
with my people.

297
00:36:32,440 --> 00:36:34,108
Thank you, doctor.

298
00:36:43,994 --> 00:36:48,038
I'd like to have Dr. Willard replaced.
I think he's too young and inexperienced.

299
00:36:48,206 --> 00:36:51,000
I'd prefer my surgeon.
Inform the administrator, please.

300
00:36:51,167 --> 00:36:54,795
- But Dr. Willard is one of our...
- I'd like him replaced, if you don't mind.

301
00:36:54,963 --> 00:36:58,757
- I'll report this to our administrator.
- Thank you very much.

302
00:37:41,134 --> 00:37:42,343
Doctor?

303
00:37:42,510 --> 00:37:44,803
A relative of mine,
he's here with a gunshot wound.

304
00:37:44,971 --> 00:37:47,014
Could you please tell me
where I can find him?

305
00:37:47,182 --> 00:37:50,434
- Why don't you try at the reception desk?
- There's no one there.

306
00:37:50,602 --> 00:37:53,228
He could be on the second floor
in the emergency room.

307
00:37:53,396 --> 00:37:54,980
Thanks, doctor.

308
00:38:03,281 --> 00:38:04,406
Yes?

309
00:38:05,158 --> 00:38:07,284
Lieutenant, it's for you.

310
00:38:13,959 --> 00:38:15,376
Thank you.

311
00:38:16,252 --> 00:38:17,336
Yes?

312
00:38:17,504 --> 00:38:20,214
Dr. Kenner. This probably
isn't important...

313
00:38:20,382 --> 00:38:24,593
...but a man asked me if a relative of his
with a gunshot wound was in the hospital.

314
00:38:24,761 --> 00:38:26,762
I thought you should know about it.

315
00:38:27,597 --> 00:38:29,431
Was he about 5' 10"? Gray hair?

316
00:38:30,433 --> 00:38:33,060
I'm afraid I told him
that he was on the second floor.

317
00:38:33,228 --> 00:38:34,603
Thank you.

318
00:38:40,068 --> 00:38:41,110
Delgetti.

319
00:38:41,277 --> 00:38:44,113
Our man is in the building.
He was tipped where to find Ross.

320
00:38:44,280 --> 00:38:46,949
- You take the ground floor, okay?
- Got it.

321
00:38:53,081 --> 00:38:57,042
Get in Ross' room. Nobody in,
except Dr. Willard and the nurses.

322
00:39:43,882 --> 00:39:46,133
There's a man down the stairs!

323
00:43:18,513 --> 00:43:21,765
Polly, call Anesthesia
and bring the crash cart.

324
00:43:24,269 --> 00:43:27,271
Doctor, there's a cardiac
arrest in the ICU.

325
00:44:00,555 --> 00:44:03,140
Get Delgetti.
You and the patrolman cover the lobby.

326
00:44:03,308 --> 00:44:04,433
Okay.

327
00:44:10,940 --> 00:44:13,108
I can't get a blood pressure.

328
00:44:13,276 --> 00:44:14,401
Go.

329
00:44:15,653 --> 00:44:18,238
Do you want to defibrillate again?

330
00:44:19,073 --> 00:44:21,450
Not now. Not with that complex.

331
00:44:26,497 --> 00:44:28,665
- How much bicarb?
- Fifteen.

332
00:44:28,833 --> 00:44:30,167
Go ahead. Push it in.

333
00:44:30,335 --> 00:44:33,086
- Do you want some lactose?
- Draw some up.

334
00:44:33,254 --> 00:44:36,840
- Any pupillary reaction?
- No. Dilated and fixed.

335
00:44:40,303 --> 00:44:42,429
Get some calcium up, too.

336
00:44:50,521 --> 00:44:53,023
What's that now? What's he got?

337
00:44:54,609 --> 00:44:56,109
No activity.

338
00:44:58,029 --> 00:45:00,197
I need some more epinephrine.

339
00:45:01,449 --> 00:45:03,492
0.5 milligram, please.

340
00:45:19,384 --> 00:45:22,469
Doctor, I need your help.

341
00:45:23,221 --> 00:45:24,721
What is it?

342
00:45:28,059 --> 00:45:29,559
I want this kept open.

343
00:45:29,727 --> 00:45:32,646
If Chalmers finds out that Ross died,
he'll fold this up.

344
00:45:32,814 --> 00:45:35,690
- I want the man that killed him.
- I understand.

345
00:45:35,858 --> 00:45:39,319
- But I don't want your head on a block.
- I understand.

346
00:45:40,071 --> 00:45:42,656
His chart could be misplaced.

347
00:45:43,533 --> 00:45:47,119
You filed it. It's missing.
I'll take the responsibility.

348
00:45:51,207 --> 00:45:52,666
All right.

349
00:46:03,511 --> 00:46:06,680
Call the coroner's office.
Tell them to put Ross under a John Doe.

350
00:46:06,848 --> 00:46:10,517
I want a private ambulance, unmarked,
and I want it quiet.

351
00:46:53,644 --> 00:46:55,645
Far as you go, doctor.

352
00:46:56,981 --> 00:46:58,607
Take it slow.

353
00:47:16,417 --> 00:47:18,835
City morgue. Let's go.

354
00:48:54,348 --> 00:48:55,765
Fresh today.

355
00:50:05,795 --> 00:50:10,382
See if Dr. Willard is still in the
hospital. Get Lt. Bullitt on the phone.

356
00:50:16,430 --> 00:50:19,933
I'm sorry, Joe.
He's been transferred to another room.

357
00:50:21,811 --> 00:50:23,478
May I have an outside line, please?

358
00:50:23,646 --> 00:50:27,691
- May I speak to your supervisor, please?
- I'm afraid she's busy at the moment.

359
00:50:27,858 --> 00:50:32,195
I'd be grateful if you'd tell her that
Chalmers wishes to see her immediately.

360
00:50:32,363 --> 00:50:35,156
- It's very urgent.
- Yes, Mr. Chalmers.

361
00:50:39,328 --> 00:50:43,081
I'd like to speak
with Dr. Willard, please. Thank you.

362
00:50:54,301 --> 00:50:56,136
Yes? Can I help you?

363
00:50:56,595 --> 00:50:58,054
I wanted the other supervisor.

364
00:50:58,222 --> 00:51:00,473
The night supervisor went off duty
an hour ago.

365
00:51:00,641 --> 00:51:02,851
I'm Mrs. Francis. May I help you?

366
00:51:03,018 --> 00:51:06,980
You may, indeed. There was
a patient here. His name is Johnny Ross.

367
00:51:07,148 --> 00:51:10,233
- And he seems to have disappeared.
- Disappeared?

368
00:51:10,401 --> 00:51:14,529
He was in Intensive Care, but there's no
record of his whereabouts in the hospital.

369
00:51:14,697 --> 00:51:16,030
That's impossible.

370
00:51:16,198 --> 00:51:19,492
- May I see his medical chart?
- I'm sorry but hospital regulations...

371
00:51:19,660 --> 00:51:23,288
It's an official police request.
Is it not, Capt. Baker?

372
00:51:24,832 --> 00:51:28,793
- Yes, captain. I'll take care of it.
- Thank you.

373
00:51:29,837 --> 00:51:33,006
Excuse me,
but Dr. Willard has gone off duty.

374
00:51:33,340 --> 00:51:35,133
Call him at home.

375
00:51:36,218 --> 00:51:40,513
- Are you sure he's not there?
- Do you have Dr. Willard's home number?

376
00:51:40,681 --> 00:51:42,223
- Dr. Willard?
- Yes.

377
00:51:42,558 --> 00:51:46,311
I'm sorry, but there's been some
medical complication with my witness.

378
00:51:46,479 --> 00:51:49,022
I'm afraid I'll have to forego
that bedside picture...

379
00:51:49,190 --> 00:51:52,692
...as much as it would've compensated
for his inability to testify tomorrow.

380
00:51:52,860 --> 00:51:55,904
But in all decency,
I can hardly force the issue.

381
00:51:56,822 --> 00:52:00,200
Does this mean your surprise witness
won't be able to make any statement?

382
00:52:00,367 --> 00:52:02,744
The man was near death
when he was brought in here.

383
00:52:02,912 --> 00:52:04,537
In view of the attempt on his life...

384
00:52:04,705 --> 00:52:06,998
...I'm sure you can understand
my reasons for secrecy.

385
00:52:07,166 --> 00:52:09,834
- Yeah, of course.
- Good to see you again.

386
00:52:12,338 --> 00:52:15,423
- Can't reach Lt. Bullitt, either.
- Keep trying.

387
00:52:15,925 --> 00:52:19,969
I can't find Mr. Ross's medical chart.
It's evidently been misplaced.

388
00:52:20,137 --> 00:52:21,888
- Or appropriated.
- Appropriated?

389
00:52:22,056 --> 00:52:25,058
All right. I'll inform the administrator.
Thank you very much.

390
00:52:27,937 --> 00:52:31,064
I want a complete list of the staff
who might've been involved...

391
00:52:31,232 --> 00:52:33,483
...in helping Bullitt spirit Johnny Ross
out of here.

392
00:52:33,651 --> 00:52:36,736
I'm certain he grabbed my witness
for his personal aggrandizement.

393
00:52:36,904 --> 00:52:38,738
- I'll lay odds on that.
- And find Ross.

394
00:52:38,906 --> 00:52:42,617
- I'll get on it right away.
- Mr. Chalmers, I have Lt. Bullitt.

395
00:52:48,207 --> 00:52:50,416
All right, where's my witness?

396
00:52:51,293 --> 00:52:52,502
I've got him.

397
00:52:53,045 --> 00:52:54,587
Where is he?

398
00:52:55,464 --> 00:52:57,590
Are you going to tell me or not?

399
00:52:58,425 --> 00:53:00,468
Well, I can't at the present time.

400
00:53:02,137 --> 00:53:05,181
Capt. Baker would like
to have a word with you.

401
00:53:08,269 --> 00:53:10,603
Now listen to me, lieutenant.

402
00:53:13,315 --> 00:53:15,900
- Nail him. I want him written off.
- No problem.

403
00:53:21,782 --> 00:53:23,783
You want some breakfast?

404
00:53:24,285 --> 00:53:25,785
Just coffee.

405
00:54:17,004 --> 00:54:18,379
Thank you.

406
00:54:20,841 --> 00:54:22,133
For what?

407
00:54:40,694 --> 00:54:41,694
All clear, lieutenant.

408
00:54:41,862 --> 00:54:43,696
- Is it open?
- The door's open, sir.

409
00:56:03,277 --> 00:56:07,113
Think back to the time the two of them
first came in and you saw them.

410
00:56:07,281 --> 00:56:08,990
Anything you can remember?

411
00:56:09,783 --> 00:56:13,119
Like I said, they hit me
before I got a chance to look at them.

412
00:56:13,287 --> 00:56:15,955
I don't remember nothing
about them. Nothing.

413
00:56:16,999 --> 00:56:19,667
- Start remembering.
- I can't.

414
00:56:20,586 --> 00:56:22,128
And that's the honest truth.

415
00:56:22,296 --> 00:56:24,505
Delgetti, take him downtown.

416
00:56:25,132 --> 00:56:27,967
Lieutenant, give him a chance, will you?
He's trying.

417
00:56:28,135 --> 00:56:30,261
He's not trying hard enough.

418
00:56:31,263 --> 00:56:33,014
It will come to him.

419
00:56:34,641 --> 00:56:36,642
You're wasting your time.

420
00:56:42,483 --> 00:56:44,150
Okay, come on.

421
00:56:45,277 --> 00:56:47,820
One thing about the guy who hit me...

422
00:56:48,322 --> 00:56:50,156
He had a square face.

423
00:56:51,617 --> 00:56:55,453
There wasn't much light here.
They try to save on electricity.

424
00:56:57,372 --> 00:56:58,581
Like this?

425
00:57:05,506 --> 00:57:07,006
No. Thinner.

426
00:57:10,385 --> 00:57:13,221
- That's it.
- Now it's coming back.

427
00:57:13,972 --> 00:57:16,224
Let's go to the guy in 634.

428
00:57:16,683 --> 00:57:19,018
- No luggage?
- That's right, sir.

429
00:57:19,353 --> 00:57:21,729
- And he didn't store anything?
- No, sir.

430
00:57:21,897 --> 00:57:24,857
He came in empty, which means
you gave him a good look-over.

431
00:57:25,025 --> 00:57:27,944
Always do.
They're the ones I give the eye to.

432
00:57:28,112 --> 00:57:29,695
Then you saw how he arrived?

433
00:57:29,863 --> 00:57:32,406
- Yes, sir. In a cab.
- What line?

434
00:57:32,825 --> 00:57:34,325
Sunshine Cab.

435
00:57:37,371 --> 00:57:41,457
- The guy who hit you, how old was he?
- About 50.

436
00:57:41,625 --> 00:57:42,917
What was his hair like?

437
00:57:43,085 --> 00:57:45,878
Gray. Getting bald. Bald on both sides.

438
00:57:46,463 --> 00:57:48,506
- That?
- No, balder.

439
00:57:49,216 --> 00:57:51,050
Am I helping you, sir?

440
00:57:51,218 --> 00:57:53,136
I never had it so good.

441
00:58:44,521 --> 00:58:46,397
His first stop was the Mark.

442
00:58:46,565 --> 00:58:48,608
- How long?
- Not long.

443
00:58:49,568 --> 00:58:51,611
Pull over there and wait.

444
00:59:39,076 --> 00:59:40,576
- Hello.
- Eddy?

445
00:59:41,245 --> 00:59:45,289
Dues time. I need some information
on a Johnny Ross. Chicago.

446
00:59:45,999 --> 00:59:48,668
Give me half an hour.
Meet you at Enrico's.

447
00:59:49,294 --> 00:59:50,503
Right.

448
01:00:00,639 --> 01:00:02,890
- Two.
- Two what?

449
01:00:03,058 --> 01:00:05,977
Calls. He called twice.
The second was long distance.

450
01:00:06,144 --> 01:00:08,688
How do you know it was long distance?

451
01:00:09,356 --> 01:00:11,232
He put in a lot of change.

452
01:00:40,012 --> 01:00:43,139
Good morning, Sam.
I don't believe I've had the pleasure.

453
01:00:43,307 --> 01:00:45,391
This is Mr. Chalmers.
My wife, Mrs. Bennet.

454
01:00:45,559 --> 01:00:48,561
- My son, Paul. My son, Tony.
- Tony, how are you?

455
01:00:48,729 --> 01:00:51,230
Would you mind
if I had a moment alone with Sam?

456
01:00:51,398 --> 01:00:53,024
No, of course not.

457
01:00:55,902 --> 01:00:59,572
Must be difficult raising children
in the world of today.

458
01:00:59,740 --> 01:01:02,408
I presume Tony is a college student.

459
01:01:02,743 --> 01:01:04,285
Yes, that's right.

460
01:01:05,412 --> 01:01:07,455
I can well imagine the financial strain...

461
01:01:07,622 --> 01:01:10,541
...of sending a boy to university
on the salary of a captain.

462
01:01:10,709 --> 01:01:13,044
There's no reason why
a man with your potential...

463
01:01:13,211 --> 01:01:16,088
...shouldn't move right up,
given the right support.

464
01:01:17,049 --> 01:01:19,925
My family is waiting for me, Mr. Chalmers.

465
01:01:21,595 --> 01:01:23,929
Bullitt abducted my witness.

466
01:01:24,681 --> 01:01:26,599
He removed him from the hospital.

467
01:01:26,767 --> 01:01:30,561
As his superior officer, I've given him
complete charge of the case.

468
01:01:30,729 --> 01:01:33,105
If he's moving Ross around,
it's for a reason.

469
01:01:34,608 --> 01:01:38,652
So you mean that you would not order
him to reveal where he's keeping Ross?

470
01:01:38,820 --> 01:01:40,946
It's his case, Mr. Chalmers.

471
01:01:43,867 --> 01:01:47,578
Captain, I'm serving you
with a writ of habeas corpus...

472
01:01:48,413 --> 01:01:51,707
...making you responsible
for the delivery of Ross.

473
01:01:53,043 --> 01:01:54,794
Duly observed...

474
01:01:54,961 --> 01:01:56,629
...you have received it.

475
01:01:58,590 --> 01:02:02,843
I need that witness
to prove his very existence.

476
01:02:03,011 --> 01:02:04,136
Now do you know...

477
01:02:04,805 --> 01:02:06,972
Excuse me, sir. Dad, Mom is waiting.

478
01:02:07,140 --> 01:02:09,600
Would you excuse us
for just another moment, Tony?

479
01:02:09,768 --> 01:02:11,268
All right, son.

480
01:02:12,062 --> 01:02:15,106
I do not choose to have
people accuse me of false promises...

481
01:02:15,273 --> 01:02:17,274
...for the sake of cheap sensationalism...

482
01:02:17,442 --> 01:02:20,986
...or to be compromised
by your lieutenant. Or castrated.

483
01:02:45,095 --> 01:02:47,304
Wait for me. I won't be long.

484
01:03:40,400 --> 01:03:44,111
According to my sources,
the Organization's Chicago branch...

485
01:03:44,279 --> 01:03:46,989
...caught Johnny Ross
with his hands in the till.

486
01:03:47,157 --> 01:03:48,699
They estimate he siphoned off...

487
01:03:48,867 --> 01:03:52,036
...about $2 million
while operating their wire service.

488
01:03:52,204 --> 01:03:56,332
The story is they tried to get rid of him.
Friday night. Chicago.

489
01:03:57,375 --> 01:03:58,542
Chicago?

490
01:03:58,710 --> 01:04:02,421
He got away unharmed.
They believe he's hiding here in town.

491
01:04:02,589 --> 01:04:04,298
How old is this information, Eddy?

492
01:04:04,466 --> 01:04:08,052
Four hours. They're looking for him
all over town, Frank.

493
01:04:08,220 --> 01:04:12,681
They've staked out the docks, the airport,
to keep him from leaving the country.

494
01:04:13,266 --> 01:04:15,267
Anyone else trying for a hit?

495
01:04:16,061 --> 01:04:17,937
Haven't heard of any such likelihood.

496
01:04:18,104 --> 01:04:19,980
What about his brother, Pete?

497
01:04:20,148 --> 01:04:21,607
In the clear.

498
01:04:23,276 --> 01:04:25,110
Okay, Eddy. Thanks.

499
01:04:25,862 --> 01:04:28,489
- Anything I can do for you?
- There is something.

500
01:04:28,657 --> 01:04:31,951
Remember Zash-Zhoe?
They gave him three to five.

501
01:04:32,118 --> 01:04:35,287
- What is he in for?
- Receiving stolen property.

502
01:04:36,122 --> 01:04:37,456
I'll try.

503
01:04:38,041 --> 01:04:39,291
Thanks, Frank.

504
01:05:02,357 --> 01:05:05,442
- Here you go.
- Take care, lieutenant.

505
01:16:16,656 --> 01:16:18,698
What the hell is going on here?

506
01:16:18,991 --> 01:16:20,325
A high-speed pursuit.

507
01:16:20,493 --> 01:16:24,246
Two men are killed. An officer in the
hospital. A witness almost murdered.

508
01:16:24,413 --> 01:16:27,332
I want to know what's happening now.
Let's hear it straight.

509
01:16:27,500 --> 01:16:28,917
Here's a report.

510
01:16:31,003 --> 01:16:34,673
A man like Chalmers
could be a great help to the department.

511
01:16:35,424 --> 01:16:37,968
He could speak for us where it counts.

512
01:16:38,135 --> 01:16:40,595
He could fight for us in the legislature.

513
01:16:41,055 --> 01:16:43,765
You have got to turn over his witness.

514
01:16:45,518 --> 01:16:46,893
Where's Ross?

515
01:16:49,647 --> 01:16:51,690
Tell him. That's an order.

516
01:16:55,736 --> 01:16:57,153
He's dead.

517
01:16:57,405 --> 01:16:59,614
- Dead?
- He died last night.

518
01:17:00,157 --> 01:17:01,533
After you moved him?

519
01:17:01,701 --> 01:17:04,661
Before. I've got him downstairs
under a John Doe.

520
01:17:07,581 --> 01:17:09,082
You are sick.

521
01:17:10,376 --> 01:17:13,211
Smuggling a dead man out of a hospital.

522
01:17:14,380 --> 01:17:17,716
And now two men killed,
who may have had nothing to do with it.

523
01:17:17,883 --> 01:17:20,302
The man I was chasing killed Ross.

524
01:17:20,469 --> 01:17:22,220
How do you know? Did you see him?

525
01:17:22,513 --> 01:17:25,223
Yes. He tried to nail me with a shotgun.

526
01:17:25,433 --> 01:17:27,100
A Winchester pump.

527
01:17:30,396 --> 01:17:34,399
The radio report said the two men
were burned beyond recognition.

528
01:17:35,109 --> 01:17:39,446
Now all he's got are two dead men.
It would never hold up in court.

529
01:17:41,198 --> 01:17:44,034
I've got one lead. I want to move on it.

530
01:17:48,497 --> 01:17:52,250
"Miss Dorothy Simmons.
Thunderbolt Hotel. San Mateo."

531
01:17:52,960 --> 01:17:56,379
Ross called her person-to-person
from a phone in Union Square...

532
01:17:56,547 --> 01:17:59,090
...approximately nine hours
before he was killed.

533
01:17:59,258 --> 01:18:01,885
So he called his girlfriend.
What does that prove?

534
01:18:12,605 --> 01:18:17,150
This is Sunday. I'm going to hold that writ
until we come to work Monday morning.

535
01:18:36,253 --> 01:18:37,712
Go on. Get out.

536
01:18:53,229 --> 01:18:54,312
I need a car.

537
01:18:54,480 --> 01:18:57,023
Sorry, lieutenant, there's no cars left.

538
01:20:02,381 --> 01:20:05,341
- Ms. Simmons doesn't answer.
- What's her room number?

539
01:20:05,509 --> 01:20:08,094
I'm sorry, we're not allowed to give...

540
01:20:08,262 --> 01:20:11,389
Front. Take this gentleman
to Room 114, please.

541
01:21:46,902 --> 01:21:48,319
Hello, Del?

542
01:21:52,241 --> 01:21:54,158
It's a strangulation.

543
01:23:28,253 --> 01:23:30,088
I thought I knew you.

544
01:23:30,798 --> 01:23:32,882
But I'm not so sure anymore.

545
01:23:34,927 --> 01:23:38,721
Do you let anything reach you?
I mean, really reach you?

546
01:23:40,140 --> 01:23:43,976
Or are you so used to it by now
that nothing really touches you?

547
01:23:44,144 --> 01:23:46,270
You're living in a sewer, Frank.

548
01:23:46,438 --> 01:23:48,189
Day after day.

549
01:23:50,234 --> 01:23:53,861
That's where half of it is.
And you can't walk away from it.

550
01:23:54,029 --> 01:23:57,949
I know it's there, but I don't have to
be reminded of the whole thing.

551
01:23:58,117 --> 01:24:00,076
The ugliness around us.

552
01:24:00,244 --> 01:24:04,956
With you, living with violence is a way
of life. Living with violence and death.

553
01:24:11,714 --> 01:24:15,842
How can you be part of it without
becoming more and more callous?

554
01:24:20,556 --> 01:24:23,474
Your world is so far from the one I know.

555
01:24:30,023 --> 01:24:32,316
What will happen to us in time?

556
01:24:36,989 --> 01:24:38,656
Time starts now.

557
01:24:50,377 --> 01:24:52,337
- What've you got?
- Let's start with the cleaver.

558
01:24:52,504 --> 01:24:56,340
One cleaver,
approximately 8 inches in length.

559
01:24:57,217 --> 01:25:00,094
Ms. Simmons' luggage
has just arrived from the airport.

560
01:25:00,262 --> 01:25:02,638
Okay. Where is it?

561
01:25:04,808 --> 01:25:07,059
- Here you go.
- One pair of gold shoes...

562
01:25:07,227 --> 01:25:10,104
- Where is it from?
- San Mateo Thunderbolt Hotel.

563
01:25:10,272 --> 01:25:11,981
- And who from?
- Simmons.

564
01:25:12,149 --> 01:25:13,524
And what do we have?

565
01:25:13,692 --> 01:25:18,112
One yellow metal locket,
yellow metal watch, pearl necklace.

566
01:25:18,655 --> 01:25:20,990
- Put a hold on these.
- Yes, sir.

567
01:25:51,438 --> 01:25:53,189
We got a man here.

568
01:25:59,238 --> 01:26:01,823
Dearborn Travel Agency, Chicago. Rome.

569
01:26:03,408 --> 01:26:05,409
Look at all this literature.

570
01:26:06,119 --> 01:26:07,620
- Rome?
- Yeah.

571
01:26:10,999 --> 01:26:14,418
What do you make out of that?
I thought she was alone.

572
01:26:15,420 --> 01:26:17,255
She's got a guy now.

573
01:26:24,221 --> 01:26:26,889
New purse, still got a price tag in it.

574
01:26:38,735 --> 01:26:40,570
Give me a bag, Tony.

575
01:26:52,374 --> 01:26:55,334
Everything is new.
They weren't even away.

576
01:26:58,922 --> 01:27:01,799
Passport? No passport. No tickets.

577
01:27:01,967 --> 01:27:04,844
Yeah, I haven't found any tickets, either.

578
01:27:14,396 --> 01:27:15,605
Bingo.

579
01:27:17,524 --> 01:27:19,233
What've you got?

580
01:27:19,735 --> 01:27:20,943
Great.

581
01:27:23,614 --> 01:27:25,698
"Albert E. Renick."

582
01:27:27,576 --> 01:27:29,744
Then who the hell is Simmons?

583
01:27:31,872 --> 01:27:35,041
Look how much money he's got.
Look at this.

584
01:27:40,964 --> 01:27:42,632
This guy is loaded.

585
01:27:43,425 --> 01:27:46,928
- We've got a Renick.
- Wonder who Renick is.

586
01:27:50,015 --> 01:27:52,099
Look what I came up with.

587
01:27:54,645 --> 01:27:56,187
Dorothy Renick.

588
01:27:57,272 --> 01:27:58,981
Okay. Drop it in.

589
01:28:01,109 --> 01:28:03,235
We're getting warm. "A.R."

590
01:28:03,904 --> 01:28:05,696
How does that grab you?

591
01:28:09,284 --> 01:28:12,828
Give me a bag, Tony.
Fingerprints on this stuff.

592
01:28:18,210 --> 01:28:19,919
Let's wrap her up.

593
01:28:30,347 --> 01:28:32,181
- Thanks, Tony.
- Okay.

594
01:28:33,642 --> 01:28:35,768
No ticket, no passport.

595
01:28:40,232 --> 01:28:43,943
Call Immigration in Chicago. Have them
wire Renick's passport applications.

596
01:28:44,111 --> 01:28:46,988
- I'll get a fingerprint check on Ross.
- Okay.

597
01:28:48,740 --> 01:28:51,909
There are multiple gunshot wounds
on the left side of the face...

598
01:28:52,077 --> 01:28:55,371
...the left side of the neck,
and about the left upper thorax.

599
01:28:55,539 --> 01:28:58,624
These extend from the lateral extent
of the left eye...

600
01:28:58,792 --> 01:29:01,502
...and a portion of the left orbit
has been lacerated...

601
01:29:01,670 --> 01:29:04,922
...and aqueous humor
protrudes from the laceration.

602
01:29:05,173 --> 01:29:08,175
There have been deep lacerations
in the immediate area...

603
01:29:08,343 --> 01:29:11,846
...and these have been approximated
by fine surgical sutures.

604
01:29:12,014 --> 01:29:15,433
There are multiple surgical incisions
about the left side of the face.

605
01:29:15,600 --> 01:29:18,352
There is considerable hemorrhage
in these deep tissues...

606
01:29:18,520 --> 01:29:21,647
...and a number of surgical sutures
are present about this area.

607
01:29:21,982 --> 01:29:24,942
There are entrances into the sinuses...

608
01:29:25,110 --> 01:29:28,279
...and several pellets are found
located within this area.

609
01:29:28,447 --> 01:29:32,408
There are also multiple lacerations
and multiple gunshot entrance wounds...

610
01:29:32,576 --> 01:29:34,160
...about the left side of the neck.

611
01:29:34,327 --> 01:29:37,496
And similar wounds are found
on the left upper thorax.

612
01:29:37,664 --> 01:29:38,956
Period. The lacerations...

613
01:29:39,124 --> 01:29:42,043
Could you send up
those prints right away?

614
01:29:44,421 --> 01:29:49,300
There's a soft rubber catheter extending
out through the lateral extent of the...

615
01:29:59,936 --> 01:30:03,147
I understand Capt. Bennet told you,
you had until Monday morning...

616
01:30:03,315 --> 01:30:05,483
...to comply with my writ of habeas corpus.

617
01:30:05,650 --> 01:30:07,485
However, I want a signed admission now...

618
01:30:07,652 --> 01:30:10,529
...that Ross died
while he was in your custody.

619
01:30:11,323 --> 01:30:13,157
When I'm ready. Yes?

620
01:30:13,325 --> 01:30:16,994
- Your photographs are coming through.
- I'll be right up. Thank you.

621
01:30:17,370 --> 01:30:20,414
I demand that signed statement. Now.

622
01:30:22,918 --> 01:30:24,251
Excuse me.

623
01:30:49,736 --> 01:30:51,445
Is that the girl?

624
01:30:52,614 --> 01:30:53,864
Yeah.

625
01:32:03,310 --> 01:32:04,560
Ross.

626
01:32:04,728 --> 01:32:06,687
"Albert Edward Renick."

627
01:32:07,105 --> 01:32:09,273
"Used car salesman. Chicago."

628
01:32:10,942 --> 01:32:12,526
Who's Renick?

629
01:32:12,694 --> 01:32:15,029
He was the man who was shot
at the Hotel Daniels.

630
01:32:15,197 --> 01:32:18,282
You sent us to guard the wrong man,
Mr. Chalmers.

631
01:32:28,960 --> 01:32:30,878
Mrs. Dorothy Renick and Mr. Al Renick...

632
01:32:31,046 --> 01:32:33,255
...have reservations
on the 7: 00 flight to Rome.

633
01:32:33,423 --> 01:32:35,216
Separate tickets. Not confirmed.

634
01:32:35,383 --> 01:32:37,176
And I got this report from Chicago.

635
01:32:37,344 --> 01:32:40,721
Renick has no record of arrests.
He's clean, Frank.

636
01:32:42,140 --> 01:32:45,309
Well, Ross took close to $2 million
from the Organization.

637
01:32:45,477 --> 01:32:48,354
And he set Renick up
to get the heat off of him.

638
01:32:48,521 --> 01:32:51,565
Then he killed Renick's
wife to shut her up.

639
01:33:36,444 --> 01:33:38,445
San Francisco Homicide.

640
01:33:38,613 --> 01:33:41,991
Do you have a Mr. Renick
on the 7: 00 flight for Rome?

641
01:33:42,158 --> 01:33:45,077
- He confirmed his flight a half hour ago.
- Did he check in yet?

642
01:33:45,245 --> 01:33:48,372
Not here, but he could do that at the gate.
Shall I call security?

643
01:33:48,540 --> 01:33:51,959
No, call the gate.
Have them recheck all the passports.

644
01:33:52,127 --> 01:33:54,211
- Which gate?
- Seventy-three.

645
01:34:03,221 --> 01:34:04,847
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.

646
01:34:05,015 --> 01:34:08,058
Clipper Flight 110
is now ready for boarding.

647
01:34:08,643 --> 01:34:12,980
We hope you have a pleasant flight,
and thank you for choosing Pan American.

648
01:34:13,148 --> 01:34:15,607
No smoking, please, beyond this point.

649
01:34:15,775 --> 01:34:19,111
Would you please have your passports
available for inspection...

650
01:34:19,279 --> 01:34:21,405
...as you pass through the departure gate?

651
01:34:38,256 --> 01:34:39,590
Excuse me.

652
01:35:16,127 --> 01:35:17,461
Pardon me.

653
01:35:28,640 --> 01:35:30,307
Step right here.

654
01:35:30,558 --> 01:35:34,728
And you're with the tour, too, are you?
There are other girls ahead of you.

655
01:35:34,896 --> 01:35:36,688
Step right on through.

656
01:36:27,282 --> 01:36:29,908
- Passenger Service.
- Can I help you, sir?

657
01:36:30,076 --> 01:36:34,455
Do you have a Renick, an Al E. Renick
on Flight 124 to London?

658
01:36:40,753 --> 01:36:41,920
What?

659
01:36:43,047 --> 01:36:47,301
Thank you. At the last minute,
on a Rome ticket. Flight Control.

660
01:37:26,758 --> 01:37:30,552
Ladies and gentlemen, we have just
been instructed to return to the gate.

661
01:37:30,720 --> 01:37:32,679
For your safety, please remain seated...

662
01:37:32,847 --> 01:37:35,349
...until the aircraft
has come to a complete stop.

663
01:37:35,517 --> 01:37:37,851
We anticipate only a short delay.

664
01:37:38,019 --> 01:37:40,979
However, all passengers are requested
to disembark...

665
01:37:41,147 --> 01:37:44,191
...and remain in the departure lounge.
Thank you.

666
01:38:35,493 --> 01:38:37,411
He's still my witness.

667
01:38:37,829 --> 01:38:41,498
I'll be delighted to let you have him
after he testifies tomorrow.

668
01:38:58,016 --> 01:38:59,683
The Organization.

669
01:39:00,351 --> 01:39:02,185
Several murders.

670
01:39:02,687 --> 01:39:04,688
Could do us both a great deal of good.

671
01:39:04,856 --> 01:39:08,734
Look, Chalmers, let's understand
each other. I don't like you.

672
01:39:09,527 --> 01:39:12,404
Come on now, don't be naive, lieutenant.

673
01:39:12,614 --> 01:39:15,073
We both know how careers are made.

674
01:39:15,241 --> 01:39:17,534
Integrity is something you sell
to the public.

675
01:39:17,702 --> 01:39:21,371
You sell whatever you want,
but don't sell it here tonight.

676
01:39:22,707 --> 01:39:24,666
Frank, we must all compromise.

677
01:39:24,834 --> 01:39:26,376
Bullshit!

678
01:39:29,714 --> 01:39:31,965
Get the hell out of here, now.

679
01:41:04,142 --> 01:41:05,475
Thank you.

680
01:41:09,981 --> 01:41:13,316
- How long will we be delayed?
- Just about 45 minutes.

681
01:41:35,673 --> 01:41:37,174
Won't be long.

682
01:44:14,332 --> 01:44:15,874
Get me the security guard.

683
01:50:00,678 --> 01:50:02,011
Ticket, please.

684
01:50:25,327 --> 01:50:27,036
All right. Get back.

685
01:51:03,073 --> 01:51:05,742
Wonder who he was, what he did.

686
01:51:10,706 --> 01:51:12,749
I heard his shots all
the way down the hall.

687
01:51:12,916 --> 01:51:14,125
He's a cop, that's what he is.

688
01:51:14,293 --> 01:51:17,378
Let's get back. Let's keep the area clear.

689
01:51:18,589 --> 01:51:20,882
Come, ladies,
you don't want to see this now.

690
01:53:41,482 --> 01:53:43,483
