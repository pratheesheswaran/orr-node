00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:20,794
Dear listeners,
we wish you a nice day.

20
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:23,713
It is now 7 minutes past 5.

21
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:26,872
We have exactly
1 hour, 28 minutes

22
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:30,749
and 30 seconds
before the New Year.

23
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:03,998
Is this gentleman wrong then?

24
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:06,230
Yes, he is talking nonsense.

25
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:08,152
Can I ask you one more question?

26
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:09,673
Whatever you want!

27
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:13,549
Can you extract this animal's sting?

28
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:16,712
It doesn't have one, my friend!

29
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:20,509
It's not a wasp, nor a scorpion!

30
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:23,752
- So a snake doesn't have a sting?
- No, it has teeth!

31
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:26,354
- Poisonous teeth?
- Of course!

32
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:28,317
Now that you know

33
00:04:28,520 --> 00:04:30,590
that a snake has poisonous teeth,

34
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:34,031
you also know that
all of these snakes are dangerous.

35
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:36,473
So with your permission,

36
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:39,553
I will tell you a poem

37
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:42,720
while I'm taking
the horned snake out.

38
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:46,320
I'll show its horns
to those who are curious.

39
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:47,310
Come on!

40
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:51,752
But don't think that a snake's horn
is like that of a deer.

41
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:55,913
It's not like the horn
of a deer, nor that of a goat.

42
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:59,072
It's like two grains of rice

43
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:05,112
on both sides of its head,
and they are called the snake's horns.

44
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:08,750
Mum, let me go buy one...
I'll be back in no time.

45
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:10,353
I said no.

46
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:37,792
- Leave it open.
- Too late.

47
00:05:37,960 --> 00:05:40,428
- Where are you going?
- To buy soap for Dad.

48
00:05:57,880 --> 00:06:01,077
- Please let me go buy it.
- I said no.

49
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:05,675
Look in the basin. Where do you
think they get them from?

50
00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:10,435
Every year, they used to take ours,
but not this year.

51
00:06:11,320 --> 00:06:14,039
It's the same goldfish
that they sell in the market.

52
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:18,316
I'll come back quickly.
I won't get lost, I promise.

53
00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:21,958
I saw them myself.

54
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:26,119
They are different.
Ours are skinny.

55
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:27,679
What did you say?

56
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:30,150
There is not even
a drop of shampoo left!

57
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:31,588
I wasn't talking to you!

58
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:35,639
Believe me, they are not the same.

59
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:37,916
Ours are so skinny!

60
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:41,274
Skinny!
You're not going to eat them!

61
00:06:42,520 --> 00:06:46,638
It looks like they are dancing
when they move their fins.

62
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:50,472
Their fins are long.
They have four of them!

63
00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:52,949
Enough. I have a lot of work to do.

64
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:55,919
Put the basket away
and get the flower pot.

65
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:58,272
But there were only 3 left.

66
00:06:58,440 --> 00:07:01,193
They will be all gone
if we don't buy one right away.

67
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:04,830
We won't have any for the New Year

68
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,309
and we won't have any
when Granny comes.

69
00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:11,553
And of course we can't celebrate
the New Year without the goldfish!

70
00:07:11,760 --> 00:07:14,593
Don't sit in a corner.
Come and catch one of these.

71
00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:17,558
Get the strainer
as well as your bowl.

72
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:20,671
Come on, get going.

73
00:07:21,880 --> 00:07:24,474
Mum, please let me go.

74
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:28,790
I'll give you all my gifts instead.

75
00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:31,716
You haven't got any gifts yet!

76
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:35,234
I'll get gifts from Granny.

77
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:37,318
I'll give them all to you.

78
00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:42,556
Not only have you put your
new clothes on before New Year

79
00:07:42,760 --> 00:07:45,832
but you've also given your gifts away
before getting them!

80
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:47,753
What's the matter?

81
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:51,071
Nothing. She's just making a fuss.
Hurry up.

82
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:53,953
If you pick up your mother late
like last year,

83
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:55,673
it'll be my fault again.

84
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:59,789
Stop whining on New Year's Eve
or you'll be crying

85
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:03,037
all year long.
Go catch a goldfish.

86
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:05,311
Take your strainer

87
00:08:05,760 --> 00:08:07,990
and wash the goldfish bowl.
Come on.

88
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:33,193
- Dad!
- What is it?

89
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:35,635
- I got it.
- It's about time!

90
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:38,149
Put the basket in the room

91
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:40,237
and the fruit next to the basin.

92
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,558
The bag just ripped.

93
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:06,959
You're whining again!

94
00:09:07,160 --> 00:09:09,515
Mum refuses to give me money
for the goldfish.

95
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:11,639
Don't you like ours?

96
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:15,593
You call these goldfish,
you haven't seen the others!

97
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:21,279
It's as though they're dancing
when they move their fins.

98
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:25,311
- And they've got so many fins!
- How much?

99
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,719
- The shopkeeper said 100 tomans.
- 100 tomans!

100
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:31,719
You want to pay 100 tomans
for a goldfish!

101
00:09:31,880 --> 00:09:34,030
You can watch two films
with that money!

102
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:36,156
You're nuts!

103
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:55,589
I tell you shampoo
and you come back with soap!

104
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,558
You never pay attention.

105
00:09:58,320 --> 00:09:59,469
Did you make him yell?

106
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:02,515
You do whatever you like!

107
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:06,152
I thought he said soap, not shampoo.

108
00:10:06,520 --> 00:10:08,954
His voice echoes.
You can't hear him from here.

109
00:10:09,880 --> 00:10:12,872
Take the soap out of water
and dry it.

110
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:14,473
Zahra!

111
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:16,358
Do you want egg shampoo?

112
00:10:16,520 --> 00:10:18,351
Yes, egg shampoo.

113
00:10:18,680 --> 00:10:21,513
- Here, hurry up.
- Shall I get shampoo then?

114
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:22,954
Yes.

115
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:34,991
You're still there?
You want to get on his nerves again?

116
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:38,399
- Hi Reza, how are you?
- Fine, thanks.

117
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:39,834
How's your mother?

118
00:10:40,280 --> 00:10:42,714
She sent me to ask you
for a goldfish.

119
00:10:42,920 --> 00:10:45,036
It's for our New Year's decoration.

120
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:47,270
You tell my Razieh:

121
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:51,149
Aren't these the same fish
as the New Year's goldfish?

122
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:52,515
Yes.

123
00:10:52,680 --> 00:10:54,989
Aren't they the same
as the ones in the market?

124
00:10:55,160 --> 00:10:56,513
- Yes.
- You see!

125
00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:02,758
Where exactly did your mother
tell you to get them from?

126
00:11:02,920 --> 00:11:04,672
From you.

127
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:08,994
You see!
You never believe what I say.

128
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:15,596
Go ahead, Reza.
Catch one for her as well.

129
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:39,434
Did you get one?

130
00:12:39,640 --> 00:12:41,073
Wonderful, isn't it?

131
00:12:41,240 --> 00:12:43,435
These are skinny,
but the others are chubby.

132
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:47,389
The shopkeeper said 100 only.
You mean we can't even pay that?

133
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:51,031
I don't believe it!
The others get their goldfish from us

134
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:53,270
and you want to get yours
from the market!

135
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:57,115
We have better things to do!
This is all you get.

136
00:12:58,040 --> 00:12:59,268
Hurry up.

137
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:01,392
Don't forget to wash the strainer.

138
00:13:01,560 --> 00:13:04,028
- What is it now?
- The water is cold!

139
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:05,269
I'm coming.

140
00:13:05,480 --> 00:13:08,552
Go check if the water-heater
is working properly.

141
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:16,355
Goodbye.

142
00:13:16,520 --> 00:13:18,750
- Goodbye. Did you catch a few?
- Yes.

143
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:20,871
How many did you get?

144
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:27,915
Dad, I got the shampoo.

145
00:13:29,080 --> 00:13:31,992
- What are you holding?
- A letter for the neighbours.

146
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:33,633
- Where from?
- Mashhad.

147
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:37,873
Slide it under their door
and get on with what you have to do.

148
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:46,593
Dear listeners, it's exactly
5 o'clock, 18 minutes and 21 seconds.

149
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:49,515
How many fish did
Reza the carrot-top catch?

150
00:13:49,720 --> 00:13:52,951
We have 1 hour, 15 minutes
and 9 seconds left to the New Year.

151
00:13:53,640 --> 00:13:55,710
Happy New Year to you all.

152
00:13:58,400 --> 00:14:00,436
Go see if the water-heater
is still on.

153
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:02,636
OK, I'll see.

154
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:04,916
Here, this is for you.

155
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,389
- What do you want in exchange?
- Nothing.

156
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:11,791
Oh, come on. You never give
anything away like that!

157
00:14:11,960 --> 00:14:16,636
Look how skinny it is.
The ones in the market are different.

158
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:19,031
They are prettier.

159
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:24,355
There were only 3 left. If we don't
buy one, they'II all be gone.

160
00:14:24,520 --> 00:14:28,195
You only give me this balloon
in exchange for the fish?

161
00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:29,475
What do you want?

162
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:32,310
- The one Uncle gave you.
- Which one?

163
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:34,436
- The one he brought last time.
- No.

164
00:14:34,640 --> 00:14:36,437
- Ali!
- What is it?

165
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:39,160
- Bring me the oil can.
- Right away.

166
00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:41,117
So, will you give it to me?

167
00:14:41,280 --> 00:14:42,599
OK.

168
00:14:42,760 --> 00:14:44,637
All right, wait a little bit.

169
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:08,839
Pour the oil in there.

170
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,594
Close the tap, the heater is off.

171
00:15:26,120 --> 00:15:27,838
Open it now.

172
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:30,038
Did you open it?

173
00:15:34,520 --> 00:15:35,669
I said no.

174
00:15:35,840 --> 00:15:38,832
Go ahead, open it.
Is it OK now?

175
00:15:40,280 --> 00:15:43,875
You haven't polished
your father's shoes yet?

176
00:15:44,040 --> 00:15:45,837
Polish yours as well.

177
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,639
You promised to buy
new shoes for me.

178
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:51,394
I'll get them for you.
Polish them for now.

179
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:54,478
Prices are high before the New Year.

180
00:16:01,280 --> 00:16:03,874
You want me to polish these as well?

181
00:16:04,120 --> 00:16:07,954
I'll repair them for you.
They'II look like new again.

182
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:10,869
Don't be a pain like your sister!

183
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:13,270
I haven't got anything left.

184
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:15,271
The money is all gone.

185
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:18,398
I've just kept a 500-toman note
for the gifts.

186
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:20,437
Five hundred!

187
00:16:21,560 --> 00:16:23,357
Who do you want to give it to?

188
00:16:23,520 --> 00:16:25,636
No one in particular!

189
00:16:25,840 --> 00:16:28,718
I'll get smaller notes.
So, if people give you money,

190
00:16:28,920 --> 00:16:31,388
I can also give some
to their children.

191
00:16:31,840 --> 00:16:35,196
Wash that too.
You better do what I tell you.

192
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:37,391
I won't ask you again!

193
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:40,675
Go on or your father
will get angry again.

194
00:17:22,840 --> 00:17:24,273
Mum!

195
00:17:25,360 --> 00:17:26,190
What now?

196
00:17:26,600 --> 00:17:28,113
I've already said no.

197
00:17:28,280 --> 00:17:31,272
Let me tell you just one thing.

198
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:34,435
I know what you're going to say
and I've had enough of it!

199
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:38,798
Just a second, promise me
you won't get angry.

200
00:17:39,040 --> 00:17:41,270
Just a second.

201
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:42,714
Do as you're told.

202
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:45,440
If you don't agree,
I won't ask you any more.

203
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:46,635
All right.

204
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:49,360
- Come closer.
- Just say it.

205
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:52,595
I want to whisper it to you.

206
00:17:52,760 --> 00:17:54,398
Come on, say it.

207
00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:36,597
OK, get my bag.

208
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:46,029
So?

209
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:49,988
- OK, but don't forget your promise.
- I told you it's yours.

210
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:52,310
Stay over there.
She mustn't see you.

211
00:18:58,040 --> 00:18:59,712
Check how much money is left.

212
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:02,791
Two twenties.

213
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:05,158
What about the small pocket?

214
00:19:05,320 --> 00:19:07,276
A 500 note.

215
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:09,829
- How much was the goldfish?
- 100.

216
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:11,993
100 for a fish!

217
00:19:12,800 --> 00:19:15,872
The shopkeeper said they all cost 100.

218
00:19:16,440 --> 00:19:17,759
Without the bowl!

219
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:23,469
Take the 500 note
and go get one for her.

220
00:19:27,160 --> 00:19:28,639
Give me the towel.

221
00:19:29,560 --> 00:19:32,279
- So, is the balloon mine?
- Yes it is.

222
00:19:32,440 --> 00:19:34,112
- Promise?
- Yes, take it.

223
00:19:34,280 --> 00:19:36,669
- You aren't allowed to go.
- I'll be back soon.

224
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:40,035
- Be careful not to lose the money.
- OK.

225
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:01,794
While you're singing,
you'II take out the snake

226
00:20:02,040 --> 00:20:06,511
- which none of these people
have even dreamt of- with this stick.

227
00:20:06,680 --> 00:20:10,275
And while you're showing it to them,

228
00:20:10,440 --> 00:20:12,158
I'll pass the hat around.

229
00:20:12,360 --> 00:20:15,432
God bless anyone
who helps me in these hard times.

230
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:18,831
Let's see how you
who are sitting around us

231
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,752
help the Dervishes.

232
00:20:22,920 --> 00:20:27,277
This is the first of the four snakes
which I promised to show you.

233
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:32,348
And in that box, there's another one
which weighs 4 and a quarter kilos.

234
00:20:32,520 --> 00:20:37,071
But these gentlemen might think
that we're not going to show it.

235
00:20:37,320 --> 00:20:40,118
That's not it.
The snake just loves money.

236
00:20:41,080 --> 00:20:45,790
It's not going to come out
until it sees the colour of money.

237
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:49,793
Dear friends, whether you're Turks,
Persians or Arabs...

238
00:20:50,040 --> 00:20:53,191
Whether you're from the north
or the south, you're all needy

239
00:20:53,560 --> 00:20:55,471
like the Dervish!

240
00:20:55,920 --> 00:21:00,072
There's only one hour left to
the New Year. I'll pass amongst you

241
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:02,879
and I know
that you'll all be generous.

242
00:21:03,080 --> 00:21:08,234
At least enough for a fish
for my kids' New Year's dinner.

243
00:21:09,240 --> 00:21:10,878
Look at this!

244
00:21:11,040 --> 00:21:15,989
They give expired bank notes
to the Dervish!

245
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:20,432
Nobody takes these any more,
neither the baker, nor the grocer!

246
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:22,592
God bless you.

247
00:21:24,680 --> 00:21:26,955
This little girl
has given us a 500 note

248
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:29,190
for the Dervish's dinner,

249
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:32,231
for his kids' dinner

250
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:34,789
and for the Dervish's fish.

251
00:21:35,240 --> 00:21:37,276
It's the proof of her generosity.

252
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:41,873
She's only 6 or 7 years old.

253
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:44,514
But thanks to her help,

254
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:49,635
the Dervish will have
something to eat tonight.

255
00:21:49,920 --> 00:21:52,992
I'm going to take the snake out now.

256
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:55,874
I'II take it out
and put in the middle

257
00:21:56,040 --> 00:21:59,749
for the New Year
so that everyone can see it.

258
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:02,550
God bless you all.

259
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:05,632
You haven't forgotten anything
for the New Year's ceremony!

260
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:07,751
What a nice bunch of Sabzeh!

261
00:22:07,960 --> 00:22:10,554
- What do you have in your bag?
- It's for New Year.

262
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:14,759
You've already the fish
for tonight's dinner!

263
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:16,996
But I know you very well!

264
00:22:17,680 --> 00:22:23,038
You're a respectful man.
Don't waste your time here.

265
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:25,760
I wanted to watch you,
because I like your act.

266
00:22:25,920 --> 00:22:27,672
God bless you, my friend!

267
00:22:28,440 --> 00:22:32,433
You're in terrific shape! I can see
the chicken you've eaten here

268
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:34,437
and the turkey there!

269
00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:38,475
Such strong young lads
we have in Iran!

270
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:40,517
I want my money.

271
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:43,474
- Sorry?
- I want my money.

272
00:22:43,800 --> 00:22:46,917
- Which money, little angel?
- The money for the fish.

273
00:22:47,160 --> 00:22:48,388
The money for the fish

274
00:22:48,560 --> 00:22:51,313
that the Dervish wanted to eat
with his rice tonight?

275
00:22:51,800 --> 00:22:56,749
You never take back what
you've given! Your money is gone.

276
00:22:58,360 --> 00:23:00,555
My partner has it now.

277
00:23:00,760 --> 00:23:02,557
It's in his pocket.

278
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:04,358
But I want my money back.

279
00:23:04,520 --> 00:23:08,479
My mother gave me a 500 note
to buy a goldfish.

280
00:23:08,840 --> 00:23:10,592
OK, I see.

281
00:23:11,560 --> 00:23:12,834
My dear Dervish...

282
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:17,109
What?

283
00:23:17,320 --> 00:23:19,675
The girl's mother
wants her money back.

284
00:23:19,880 --> 00:23:21,836
What do you think of that?

285
00:23:22,160 --> 00:23:24,674
- But she didn't give it to us!
- Who to then?

286
00:23:24,840 --> 00:23:28,150
To this snake, to this penny-pincher!

287
00:23:28,680 --> 00:23:32,309
So we'll put her money here

288
00:23:32,520 --> 00:23:34,511
so that she can come and take it.

289
00:23:35,840 --> 00:23:37,956
Here is the money!

290
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:40,790
Come get your money, angel.

291
00:23:41,640 --> 00:23:43,596
My dear Dervish!

292
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:48,355
What'll we do
with this little girl?

293
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:51,510
Do you have any ideas?

294
00:23:52,120 --> 00:23:55,908
I don't know!
Let's give her a chance

295
00:23:56,400 --> 00:24:00,871
so that she can come
and take her money.

296
00:24:01,240 --> 00:24:04,198
But if she doesn't come quickly,

297
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:08,393
the snake will wake up
and she won't be able

298
00:24:08,600 --> 00:24:10,272
to take it back!

299
00:24:10,440 --> 00:24:12,670
Did you hear
what the Dervish just said?

300
00:24:18,560 --> 00:24:21,199
Didn't I tell you
this snake is a penny-pincher?

301
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:23,749
Look here, little girl!

302
00:24:23,960 --> 00:24:27,077
You see, gentlemen,
that the Dervish never lies!

303
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:31,875
The snake wouldn't peep out
as long as there was no money.

304
00:24:32,680 --> 00:24:34,432
If this girl wants her money,

305
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:36,154
she must get it herself.

306
00:24:36,320 --> 00:24:38,550
I'll do it myself.

307
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:42,316
I'll take her money
and give it back to her.

308
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:43,913
- Sure?
- Sure.

309
00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:45,638
- Won't you regret it?
- No.

310
00:24:45,800 --> 00:24:47,870
How stubborn you can be!

311
00:24:48,040 --> 00:24:50,156
Let her come on her own!

312
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:53,872
Here sweetie,
come look at the snake.

313
00:24:54,760 --> 00:24:56,591
It's coming out
because of her.

314
00:24:56,800 --> 00:24:59,314
You want it to jump on her?

315
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:04,034
Who has the guts
to come and take it?

316
00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:08,390
Get back
before somebody gets bitten.

317
00:25:08,800 --> 00:25:10,756
Stop insisting!

318
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:13,633
Look gentlemen,

319
00:25:13,800 --> 00:25:18,510
wait and see if this snake
is going to let the money go.

320
00:25:18,680 --> 00:25:21,114
Do I look like a liar?

321
00:25:21,320 --> 00:25:24,278
With my white hair
and my old age!

322
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:27,476
Just wait and see if I was lying!

323
00:25:27,720 --> 00:25:31,190
- What're you going to do now?
- Give the money back to her.

324
00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:34,750
You never listen to me! We'd have
had something to eat tonight!

325
00:25:34,920 --> 00:25:39,311
With whose money
did you want to eat?

326
00:25:39,480 --> 00:25:42,074
That's why your pocket
is always empty!

327
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:44,515
You didn't expect me
to keep her money?

328
00:25:44,680 --> 00:25:46,511
Don't you see she's crying?

329
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:50,030
The money is not hers,
it's her mother's.

330
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:53,313
Here you go, little girl.

331
00:25:53,880 --> 00:25:55,996
This snake likes the colour of money!

332
00:25:56,560 --> 00:25:58,391
See, it doesn't come out

333
00:25:58,560 --> 00:26:00,915
till it sees the money!
I wasn't lying!

334
00:26:01,480 --> 00:26:03,755
My little angel!

335
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:07,597
Are you afraid of this snake?
It doesn't have teeth!

336
00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:09,876
We just say that to make a living,

337
00:26:10,600 --> 00:26:13,034
to bring some food home.

338
00:26:13,280 --> 00:26:15,874
Look, not even a single tooth.
Don't be scared.

339
00:26:16,040 --> 00:26:19,635
I'II put it in my pocket
so that it doesn't frighten you.

340
00:26:19,920 --> 00:26:21,148
Look.

341
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:23,431
Is it OK now?

342
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:30,391
Wipe your tears.
It's all over now.

343
00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:34,592
Nobody should go away after my act
with wet eyes.

344
00:26:34,760 --> 00:26:39,515
Give me a smile and I'II give you
your money. That's a good girl.

345
00:26:41,920 --> 00:26:43,478
Here's your 500 note.

346
00:26:45,040 --> 00:26:46,917
Go. God bless you.

347
00:27:48,120 --> 00:27:48,950
Hi.

348
00:27:49,280 --> 00:27:51,157
Hello. What can I do for you?

349
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:54,071
I want a goldfish.

350
00:27:54,400 --> 00:27:55,879
Which one do you want?

351
00:27:56,400 --> 00:27:58,470
One of those.
One of the white ones

352
00:27:58,680 --> 00:27:59,954
with plenty of fins.

353
00:28:00,120 --> 00:28:02,236
- You want a big one?
- Yes.

354
00:28:02,400 --> 00:28:03,958
Then it's 200.

355
00:28:04,680 --> 00:28:07,194
But you said yourself
that they cost 100!

356
00:28:07,360 --> 00:28:08,634
Not all of them!

357
00:28:08,840 --> 00:28:12,230
The small ones cost 100,
but the big, pretty ones cost 200.

358
00:28:12,680 --> 00:28:17,549
But since it's you, I'll sell
this little cute one for 100 only!

359
00:28:18,520 --> 00:28:21,671
Hello, madam, welcome!

360
00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:27,517
Feel at home.

361
00:28:28,120 --> 00:28:30,839
So where is your money?
Let me see it.

362
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:34,318
Can't you give me a big one
for 100 tomans?

363
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:37,995
No, the big ones cost 200.
How much do you have?

364
00:28:39,480 --> 00:28:41,835
Show me your money.

365
00:28:43,840 --> 00:28:45,671
Come on, take it out.

366
00:28:47,360 --> 00:28:49,510
What've you done with it?

367
00:28:51,960 --> 00:28:54,952
Look in your pocket.
Where did you put it?

368
00:28:56,200 --> 00:28:58,668
I've lost my 500 note!

369
00:28:58,880 --> 00:29:00,472
Where did you lose it?

370
00:29:01,920 --> 00:29:03,911
I'd put it in my goldfish bowl.

371
00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:07,709
- And who has taken it?
- I don't know.

372
00:29:07,880 --> 00:29:11,190
Hey, what's up now?
What's up with you?

373
00:29:11,840 --> 00:29:13,876
I brought 10 earlier.
Here are 5 more.

374
00:29:14,040 --> 00:29:15,473
That makes 15.

375
00:29:15,640 --> 00:29:17,790
- How much did you get earlier?
- 200.

376
00:29:17,960 --> 00:29:20,349
How much more do you want?
250?

377
00:29:20,600 --> 00:29:22,955
Here my boy, there you go.

378
00:29:23,120 --> 00:29:25,156
Now beat it!

379
00:29:29,480 --> 00:29:34,315
Business is hard and on top of that,
this girl is crying.

380
00:29:34,560 --> 00:29:36,278
How much did you have,
little missy?

381
00:29:36,440 --> 00:29:37,475
500 tomans.

382
00:29:37,640 --> 00:29:39,358
You're sure you had a 500 note?

383
00:29:39,520 --> 00:29:41,795
- Yes.
- What did you want to buy with it?

384
00:29:41,960 --> 00:29:43,359
Afish.

385
00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:45,556
What sort of a fish?

386
00:29:46,040 --> 00:29:47,758
One of those in that bowl.

387
00:29:48,360 --> 00:29:51,397
But those don't cost 500!

388
00:29:51,560 --> 00:29:54,791
Maybe you were supposed
to buy a big fish.

389
00:29:56,080 --> 00:29:57,308
No.

390
00:29:57,600 --> 00:29:59,795
But those don't cost that much!

391
00:30:00,040 --> 00:30:03,510
- Are you sure?
- Yes.

392
00:30:04,040 --> 00:30:05,871
Can you actually recognize
a 500 note?

393
00:30:06,040 --> 00:30:06,950
Yes.

394
00:30:07,240 --> 00:30:09,879
- What colour is it?
- Red.

395
00:30:11,240 --> 00:30:13,151
Was it like this one?

396
00:30:14,440 --> 00:30:15,759
No.

397
00:30:16,680 --> 00:30:18,636
- So it wasn't this one?
- No.

398
00:30:20,680 --> 00:30:22,557
Wasn't it this one?

399
00:30:23,720 --> 00:30:25,676
No, it was red.

400
00:30:26,160 --> 00:30:27,957
It was red!

401
00:30:28,520 --> 00:30:30,192
- Are you sure about that?
- Yes.

402
00:30:31,320 --> 00:30:33,038
Was it like this one?

403
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:35,555
- Yes, that's it.
- But this one is mine!

404
00:30:36,080 --> 00:30:39,993
This is my money.
You never gave me a 500 note!

405
00:30:40,280 --> 00:30:43,795
What a day! They gave you
a 500 note to buy a goldfish

406
00:30:43,960 --> 00:30:46,793
and look what a mess you're in now!

407
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:48,911
Plus, you're wasting my time!

408
00:30:49,080 --> 00:30:51,275
Don't cry.
Go back the way you came

409
00:30:51,480 --> 00:30:55,075
and you'll find your money.

410
00:30:55,240 --> 00:30:57,071
What can I do for you, madam?

411
00:30:59,880 --> 00:31:01,950
Take the same way back
and you'II find it.

412
00:31:02,200 --> 00:31:03,633
Don't cry.

413
00:31:03,800 --> 00:31:06,917
She'II never find her money!

414
00:31:07,320 --> 00:31:10,232
Of course she will! Nobody looks
at the ground these days

415
00:31:10,440 --> 00:31:12,396
even if it's covered with gold!

416
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:15,633
Go ahead, sweetie.
Wipe your tears now.

417
00:31:15,920 --> 00:31:19,151
Take the same road
and you might find it.

418
00:31:41,040 --> 00:31:44,476
- Hello, Savage, how're you?
- Get lost!

419
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:50,993
What is it, honey?
Why're you crying?

420
00:31:51,160 --> 00:31:55,153
I wanted to buy a goldfish,
but I lost my money.

421
00:31:55,320 --> 00:31:58,278
- That's OK. I'll buy one for you.
- No.

422
00:31:58,440 --> 00:32:03,389
Where did you lose it?
Which road did you go down?

423
00:32:03,720 --> 00:32:08,589
Go back the same way and you'll
find it. Stop crying now. Go on.

424
00:32:09,960 --> 00:32:11,837
You're still here?

425
00:32:12,440 --> 00:32:14,556
Didn't you find your money?

426
00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:16,950
No, I didn't.

427
00:32:17,120 --> 00:32:20,669
You're right, it's hard.
Where do you live?

428
00:32:20,840 --> 00:32:23,070
- Over there.
- I'll come with you.

429
00:32:23,440 --> 00:32:26,910
Think hard.
Do you remember where you lost it?

430
00:32:27,080 --> 00:32:29,674
Did you pass by this place?

431
00:32:29,840 --> 00:32:32,479
Over there,
next to the snake charmers.

432
00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:36,519
Where is your bowl?
Why aren't you carrying it?

433
00:32:36,680 --> 00:32:39,478
- I left it in the shop.
- But why?

434
00:32:39,760 --> 00:32:42,638
I won't take it back

435
00:32:43,240 --> 00:32:45,595
till I get my goldfish!

436
00:32:46,360 --> 00:32:48,316
That's where I stopped.

437
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:51,598
Here! Why did you come here?

438
00:32:52,040 --> 00:32:57,034
You shouldn't have.
This is no place for you!

439
00:32:57,440 --> 00:32:58,589
Have you seen

440
00:32:58,800 --> 00:33:00,870
a single girl like yourself

441
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:04,909
or a woman like me here?

442
00:33:05,240 --> 00:33:10,394
Haven't your parents ever told you
not to come here?

443
00:33:11,080 --> 00:33:13,275
Every time we went past this place,

444
00:33:13,480 --> 00:33:17,359
I'd ask my parents
to let me watch a bit,

445
00:33:18,280 --> 00:33:22,193
but they never wanted to.
Once, before I started school,

446
00:33:22,520 --> 00:33:23,953
I saw a man watching

447
00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:26,993
with his daughter on his shoulders,

448
00:33:27,160 --> 00:33:31,278
so I asked my father
to lift me up as well,

449
00:33:31,720 --> 00:33:35,759
but he said
this was no place for girls.

450
00:33:35,920 --> 00:33:37,990
He pulled me away
and made me follow him.

451
00:33:38,160 --> 00:33:40,913
Today, as I went past,
I suddenly saw

452
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:44,715
that my mother was walking
ahead of me, so I stopped to see.

453
00:33:45,280 --> 00:33:48,989
Here we go again!
I told you, this is no place for you.

454
00:33:49,560 --> 00:33:52,154
I wanted to see
what was not good for me...

455
00:33:52,320 --> 00:33:54,276
what they never let me see.

456
00:33:54,440 --> 00:33:57,750
Have you understood now
why it's not good for you?

457
00:33:58,320 --> 00:33:59,230
Yes.

458
00:33:59,400 --> 00:34:01,550
So you won't come back here
any more?

459
00:34:01,720 --> 00:34:06,032
No, but there are snake charmers
here all the time, aren't there?

460
00:34:06,520 --> 00:34:08,078
You've forgotten your promise!

461
00:34:08,640 --> 00:34:12,394
When did you last see your money?

462
00:34:12,560 --> 00:34:15,233
When I gave it to the Dervish.

463
00:34:15,720 --> 00:34:17,995
You gave your money to him?

464
00:34:18,600 --> 00:34:20,591
Are you sure
he gave it back to you?

465
00:34:20,760 --> 00:34:23,069
Yes, but it wasn't him.

466
00:34:23,240 --> 00:34:26,391
The other man, the one
with the white hair gave it to me.

467
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:28,518
Where do you last remember
seeing it?

468
00:34:28,680 --> 00:34:31,194
At the cake shop.

469
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:35,115
The one at the corner
of the big avenue.

470
00:34:35,360 --> 00:34:38,955
I stopped and looked in the window.

471
00:34:39,200 --> 00:34:43,591
I looked at the cream puffs
and at my bowl, before going away.

472
00:34:48,720 --> 00:34:50,836
This is the cake shop.

473
00:34:53,560 --> 00:34:55,232
Where were you standing?

474
00:34:55,400 --> 00:34:57,436
Come, I'II show you.

475
00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:04,997
Over here.

476
00:35:06,160 --> 00:35:09,072
But there is no money here.

477
00:35:09,240 --> 00:35:11,993
I'm sure it was here.

478
00:35:12,840 --> 00:35:15,115
Come, let's go closer and look.

479
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:17,669
And what if I don't find it?

480
00:35:19,320 --> 00:35:24,474
I'll tell your mother
that it wasn't your fault.

481
00:35:24,640 --> 00:35:27,598
Whose fault is it then,
if not mine?

482
00:35:28,080 --> 00:35:30,150
It is yours actually!

483
00:35:30,440 --> 00:35:35,912
But I'Iljust tell her that
to calm her down.

484
00:35:38,440 --> 00:35:39,316
My money!

485
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:05,151
You've worn me out, little girl.
Let me sit down for a minute.

486
00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:10,072
- We'll go to Mr. Bakhtiari's.
- What about my money?

487
00:36:10,520 --> 00:36:13,159
But you just found it!

488
00:36:13,320 --> 00:36:17,108
We'll go to the shop owner

489
00:36:17,440 --> 00:36:20,910
before he goes home
for the New Year's celebrations.

490
00:36:21,120 --> 00:36:23,839
We'll ask him to give
your money back to you.

491
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:27,879
And you'II take it
and buy your goldfish.

492
00:36:28,160 --> 00:36:30,116
This is all that matters.

493
00:36:31,440 --> 00:36:33,795
Come on, let's go.

494
00:36:39,200 --> 00:36:42,192
My regards to your father.

495
00:36:44,120 --> 00:36:46,588
- Hello, Mr. Bakhtiari.
- Hello, madam.

496
00:36:46,840 --> 00:36:48,671
Nice to see you again.
How are you doing?

497
00:36:48,840 --> 00:36:50,717
May I ask you a favour?

498
00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:55,995
This little girl's money
has fallen in the cellar.

499
00:36:56,200 --> 00:36:59,670
Could you give it back to her?
It's fallen in the cellar next door.

500
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:02,118
OK.

501
00:37:03,160 --> 00:37:06,630
Why are you still crying?

502
00:37:06,840 --> 00:37:08,637
You found your money!

503
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:11,633
You can go and buy your fish.
I have to go now.

504
00:37:12,040 --> 00:37:16,113
Goodbye and Happy New Year.

505
00:37:17,120 --> 00:37:19,429
Same to you. Goodbye.

506
00:37:24,280 --> 00:37:27,397
- Finished that shirt?
- There's still one sleeve left.

507
00:37:27,560 --> 00:37:30,154
Do this one first.
The client'll be here any minute.

508
00:37:30,360 --> 00:37:32,157
He'II make a fuss again!

509
00:37:34,040 --> 00:37:35,712
Take this one as well

510
00:37:38,520 --> 00:37:41,910
and finish it after the other one.
Hurry up.

511
00:37:49,680 --> 00:37:51,591
What's wrong?

512
00:37:52,080 --> 00:37:54,674
The collar's too big?
You wanted it this way.

513
00:37:55,480 --> 00:37:57,357
You even brought me a pattern.

514
00:37:57,520 --> 00:37:59,238
I made it like the pattern.

515
00:37:59,400 --> 00:38:04,758
Look, this is another client's order.
I've written it all down here.

516
00:38:05,560 --> 00:38:09,235
I've done exactly what he asked for.

517
00:38:09,560 --> 00:38:12,199
It's true that the collar is too big.

518
00:38:12,360 --> 00:38:15,352
And I actually never make
shirts like this.

519
00:38:15,560 --> 00:38:18,313
But it's not my fault.
You chose the pattern.

520
00:38:18,480 --> 00:38:21,836
Don't get angry.
I just asked you to change it.

521
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:25,310
Look, I have a small face.
Even on the shirt I'm wearing now,

522
00:38:25,840 --> 00:38:27,592
the collar is small, you see?

523
00:38:28,360 --> 00:38:31,033
I can't change the collar.
You have to take it as it is.

524
00:38:31,200 --> 00:38:34,670
Don't waste my time.
It's New Year's Day

525
00:38:34,840 --> 00:38:38,310
and I still have other clients.
Why are you being such a pain?

526
00:38:40,160 --> 00:38:41,673
You're being stubborn!

527
00:38:41,880 --> 00:38:43,950
I'm not being stubborn.

528
00:38:44,120 --> 00:38:47,669
I've done my job. It's up to you
to wear the shirt or not!

529
00:38:48,200 --> 00:38:50,191
What's the matter, little girl?

530
00:38:50,480 --> 00:38:54,473
My money's fallen by the shop
with the metal shutter.

531
00:38:54,920 --> 00:38:56,751
You mean next door?

532
00:38:57,360 --> 00:38:59,430
I wanted to go buy a goldfish.

533
00:39:00,720 --> 00:39:03,109
My mother gave me
the money for the fish.

534
00:39:03,640 --> 00:39:06,359
If you don't want to change it now,

535
00:39:06,720 --> 00:39:08,472
promise you'll do it next week.

536
00:39:09,160 --> 00:39:13,358
My dear friend, you don't seem
to understand that it's not possible.

537
00:39:13,520 --> 00:39:16,830
I'm not responsible for your neck
nor your face nor your head.

538
00:39:17,640 --> 00:39:21,349
Stop telling me your head
is too big or too small.

539
00:39:22,360 --> 00:39:24,635
Why don't you have it repaired?

540
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:29,232
It's not my job.
I don't repair heads!

541
00:39:29,760 --> 00:39:33,753
I'm not responsible for that.
I just do my job.

542
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:37,276
Take it.
The rest is not my business.

543
00:39:37,440 --> 00:39:40,830
It's not my fault.
The problem is in your own body.

544
00:39:41,040 --> 00:39:43,508
It won't take you
more than half an hour.

545
00:39:43,680 --> 00:39:47,514
It's not like chopping a piece of
wood. I'd have to change the collar.

546
00:39:47,680 --> 00:39:50,240
What've I done to deserve this?

547
00:40:07,160 --> 00:40:10,550
- How much is the fish?
- 1500 tomans.

548
00:40:13,920 --> 00:40:15,353
I found my money, sir.

549
00:40:15,840 --> 00:40:19,719
Here you are again.
I'd told you that you'd find it.

550
00:40:20,280 --> 00:40:23,238
It was not worth
worrying and crying.

551
00:40:23,400 --> 00:40:25,072
Where is it now?

552
00:40:25,360 --> 00:40:28,830
I don't have it on me.
It's fallen into a shop's cellar.

553
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:30,638
I wanted to get it,

554
00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:34,395
but the shop owner
was arguing with a man.

555
00:40:35,120 --> 00:40:37,839
I just came to see
if my fish was still here.

556
00:40:38,080 --> 00:40:40,640
I'm going back
to take my money out.

557
00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:43,598
But you won't sell my fish now,
will you?

558
00:40:44,160 --> 00:40:46,435
Don't worry, little missy,

559
00:40:46,600 --> 00:40:49,672
but promise to come and buy it.
Which one do you want?

560
00:40:51,120 --> 00:40:53,554
That one.
The one which is as white as a bride.

561
00:40:53,800 --> 00:40:56,553
It's really pretty and chubby.

562
00:40:57,040 --> 00:40:58,234
I want that one.

563
00:40:58,400 --> 00:41:02,439
You'll have the one that's as pretty
as you are, but it costs 200.

564
00:41:02,640 --> 00:41:04,631
My mother told me

565
00:41:04,840 --> 00:41:06,353
to spend only 100.

566
00:41:06,520 --> 00:41:08,636
OK, it doesn't matter.

567
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:12,076
You can take it
when you get your money back.

568
00:41:12,240 --> 00:41:14,390
I'II give you the other 100 myself.

569
00:41:14,560 --> 00:41:16,437
- OK?
- No. I won't take it now.

570
00:41:16,600 --> 00:41:18,750
Why? You can take it now.

571
00:41:19,640 --> 00:41:22,473
No, I won't.
Just promise not to sell it.

572
00:41:22,640 --> 00:41:24,710
I promise, little missy.

573
00:41:24,920 --> 00:41:27,480
I'll keep an eye on it
till you come back.

574
00:41:28,640 --> 00:41:31,359
Where is your goldfish bowl?
Give it to me.

575
00:41:31,840 --> 00:41:35,992
I put it here
while you were talking to that lady.

576
00:41:36,200 --> 00:41:39,112
- I didn't see any bowl.
- Of course you did!

577
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:42,639
- Are you sure about that?
- Yes.

578
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:44,149
Mohammed!

579
00:41:44,720 --> 00:41:47,917
This little girl tells me
she left her bowl in the shop.

580
00:41:48,360 --> 00:41:50,920
Fill one of the bowls with water.

581
00:41:55,240 --> 00:41:56,389
Here it is.

582
00:42:04,280 --> 00:42:05,952
- Where're you going?
- For water.

583
00:42:06,120 --> 00:42:07,792
Come back quickly.

584
00:42:10,680 --> 00:42:14,150
Here's your little fish.
All pretty and round.

585
00:42:14,760 --> 00:42:16,671
But this one is all skinny!

586
00:42:16,840 --> 00:42:19,593
I wanted a chubby one.

587
00:42:20,440 --> 00:42:24,558
You're looking at it from above.
It looks skinny that way. Watch now!

588
00:42:24,720 --> 00:42:29,111
See how big it is!
You have to look at it this way.

589
00:42:30,040 --> 00:42:33,316
It's round and pretty,
a real beauty. Take it!

590
00:42:39,800 --> 00:42:42,189
I'll go get my money first.

591
00:42:42,360 --> 00:42:44,669
You can pay me later, I don't mind.

592
00:42:46,120 --> 00:42:47,633
No, I'll be right back.

593
00:43:12,200 --> 00:43:14,270
Where were you all this time?

594
00:43:16,320 --> 00:43:18,072
What's happened to your face?

595
00:43:18,280 --> 00:43:19,918
None of your business!

596
00:43:20,400 --> 00:43:22,277
Where's your bowl and the money?

597
00:43:29,600 --> 00:43:30,953
I lost the money.

598
00:43:31,560 --> 00:43:32,629
You lost it?

599
00:43:33,280 --> 00:43:35,396
No, not really.

600
00:43:35,560 --> 00:43:38,472
First I lost it,
but then I found it.

601
00:43:38,760 --> 00:43:39,909
Where is it now?

602
00:44:00,640 --> 00:44:03,632
You idiot!
We'II never be able to get it out.

603
00:44:41,960 --> 00:44:43,678
What're we going to do then?

604
00:44:43,840 --> 00:44:45,796
We'll try to get it out.

605
00:44:46,040 --> 00:44:47,758
But how?

606
00:44:50,120 --> 00:44:51,872
Whose shop is it?

607
00:44:52,160 --> 00:44:55,038
The owner is the man
next to the tree.

608
00:44:55,960 --> 00:44:57,439
Which one?

609
00:44:57,600 --> 00:44:59,909
The one who's leaning against it.

610
00:45:02,400 --> 00:45:04,470
He's the one who started arguing.

611
00:45:04,680 --> 00:45:08,389
I won't take this sort of a thing
from a youth!

612
00:45:09,160 --> 00:45:12,994
He kept telling me
that his head was too small,

613
00:45:13,280 --> 00:45:16,716
that his neck was too long,
that the collar didn't fit him.

614
00:45:16,880 --> 00:45:18,108
It's not my problem.

615
00:45:18,280 --> 00:45:20,840
Don't get angry again!
Drink some water.

616
00:45:21,520 --> 00:45:25,354
- Here, take a smoke.
- He's young enough to be your son.

617
00:45:25,520 --> 00:45:28,432
I might have done it
if he hadn't started...

618
00:45:28,600 --> 00:45:31,114
You should've given him a shirt
for New Year.

619
00:45:31,360 --> 00:45:33,999
It's not my fault
if his head is too small!

620
00:45:34,160 --> 00:45:36,833
He could have it repaired elsewhere!

621
00:45:37,080 --> 00:45:39,548
I made him the shirt he asked for.

622
00:45:39,720 --> 00:45:41,438
Two years ago, he did

623
00:45:41,640 --> 00:45:44,712
exactly the same thing to me.
He was in the army last year.

624
00:45:44,920 --> 00:45:46,990
He should've stayed there!

625
00:45:47,280 --> 00:45:51,353
He doesn't have a penny in his pocket,
but keeps giving orders.

626
00:45:51,920 --> 00:45:54,229
Do the shirt this way,
do it that way!

627
00:45:54,400 --> 00:45:56,994
It's good to remember who you are,

628
00:45:57,160 --> 00:45:58,752
where you come from

629
00:45:58,960 --> 00:46:01,155
and what you're worth!

630
00:46:02,760 --> 00:46:06,309
So what shouldn't have happened
has happened!

631
00:46:06,480 --> 00:46:09,472
I couldn't control myself.

632
00:46:09,800 --> 00:46:11,756
But I don't feel good about it.

633
00:46:11,960 --> 00:46:13,712
Sir, my money.

634
00:46:13,920 --> 00:46:15,990
Still here?
Why haven't you gone home?

635
00:46:16,280 --> 00:46:18,475
We should be going, Mr. Bakhtiari.

636
00:46:20,120 --> 00:46:22,315
Sorry about the trouble. Goodbye.

637
00:46:24,560 --> 00:46:27,552
Where're you going?
Stay where you are.

638
00:46:29,840 --> 00:46:32,195
- Have you finished the blue shirt?
- Yes.

639
00:46:34,400 --> 00:46:35,799
Where is he now?

640
00:46:36,840 --> 00:46:38,831
Filing a complaint against you.

641
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:41,719
- Is the shop next door yours?
- No, some one else's.

642
00:46:41,880 --> 00:46:43,438
Can I leave now?

643
00:46:43,600 --> 00:46:45,431
Are you done with your work?
Good.

644
00:46:45,600 --> 00:46:47,431
- Have you done everything?
- Yes.

645
00:46:47,720 --> 00:46:49,915
- Where're you going?
- My home town.

646
00:46:50,120 --> 00:46:51,951
Don't forget a present for me.

647
00:46:55,600 --> 00:46:58,273
Could I have my money back please?

648
00:46:59,240 --> 00:47:02,835
Here's a box of pastry and 2 shirts.
Happy New Year to you.

649
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:06,515
Don't forget.
I'll see you in a week's time.

650
00:47:06,960 --> 00:47:09,428
I'd like to go back home
- if you allow me -

651
00:47:10,240 --> 00:47:11,958
till the thirteenth.

652
00:47:12,120 --> 00:47:14,759
All right, but no longer.
We have a lot of work.

653
00:47:14,920 --> 00:47:16,911
I'II be back on time. Goodbye.

654
00:47:20,520 --> 00:47:21,953
What do you want?

655
00:47:22,200 --> 00:47:23,599
My money.

656
00:47:24,720 --> 00:47:27,678
It's not my shop
and the owner has gone on a trip.

657
00:47:28,200 --> 00:47:32,796
Come back after New Year
and you'll get your money.

658
00:47:57,880 --> 00:48:00,838
- It's right next door.
- Where the girl pointed to?

659
00:48:01,040 --> 00:48:03,600
- She's my sister.
- What can I do about it?

660
00:48:03,960 --> 00:48:07,157
- Can't you take the money out?
- I'm not the owner.

661
00:48:07,960 --> 00:48:09,757
Is Hossein in Tehran?

662
00:48:09,960 --> 00:48:11,757
Impossible. You know him!

663
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:14,878
He's out of town
whenever he can.

664
00:48:15,040 --> 00:48:17,190
He goes along with his wife's whims!

665
00:48:17,360 --> 00:48:20,636
He's certainly gone now.
But don't worry about your money.

666
00:48:20,840 --> 00:48:22,239
It's in a safe place.

667
00:48:22,400 --> 00:48:24,152
Go home now

668
00:48:24,560 --> 00:48:28,997
and come back next week
and you'll get your money.

669
00:48:30,240 --> 00:48:32,196
Try to understand.

670
00:48:33,240 --> 00:48:35,310
- Forget about it.
- What must I do?

671
00:48:35,840 --> 00:48:37,956
- What more do you want?
- My money.

672
00:48:38,120 --> 00:48:44,036
I don't have the keys to the shop.
Come back next week.

673
00:48:44,960 --> 00:48:46,359
Mr. Bakhtiari...

674
00:48:46,600 --> 00:48:49,319
let me come back here
with your client.

675
00:48:49,480 --> 00:48:53,632
- He must've realized his mistake.
- OK, if you really insist.

676
00:48:53,800 --> 00:48:57,509
- Thanks for your concern.
- I'll see you later then.

677
00:48:58,800 --> 00:49:00,836
- What can we do?
- I don't know.

678
00:49:01,320 --> 00:49:03,356
How should I know!

679
00:49:03,680 --> 00:49:07,229
The shop is closed
and the owner is on a trip.

680
00:49:09,120 --> 00:49:10,678
I'll help you next week.

681
00:49:11,560 --> 00:49:12,788
Go now.

682
00:49:17,240 --> 00:49:20,949
There is exactly 42 minutes
and 20 seconds left till the New Year.

683
00:50:32,720 --> 00:50:36,554
The sea is rough, brother,
the sea is rough...

684
00:51:04,200 --> 00:51:06,316
How can I get it?

685
00:51:23,400 --> 00:51:25,197
What do you want, my boy?

686
00:51:25,360 --> 00:51:28,238
- My money's stuck there.
- I can't do anything for you.

687
00:51:28,440 --> 00:51:30,670
- Can I borrow this from you?
- What?

688
00:51:30,840 --> 00:51:33,479
The rod you use
for the metal shutter.

689
00:51:33,640 --> 00:51:34,789
Why?

690
00:51:34,960 --> 00:51:36,951
It's only for a minute.

691
00:51:37,800 --> 00:51:41,236
OK, but hurry up. I have to leave.

692
00:51:46,680 --> 00:51:48,955
Try it from the side of the grid.

693
00:52:04,680 --> 00:52:06,557
What're you up to?

694
00:52:08,280 --> 00:52:09,190
I don't know!

695
00:52:09,360 --> 00:52:12,033
What do you mean?
You'll never manage this way!

696
00:52:12,920 --> 00:52:16,469
Give that to me.
I'll try to get it out.

697
00:52:31,840 --> 00:52:33,273
It's impossible.

698
00:52:33,560 --> 00:52:36,313
This is good for the shutter,
but not for this.

699
00:52:36,680 --> 00:52:40,389
If only we could turn the hook
the other way...

700
00:52:40,600 --> 00:52:41,669
Can you do it?

701
00:52:41,840 --> 00:52:45,594
Impossible. The hook is welded.

702
00:52:46,240 --> 00:52:49,630
It's not made for this.
It's just to pull the shutter down.

703
00:52:49,800 --> 00:52:52,997
Go home and come back
in a week's time.

704
00:52:53,200 --> 00:52:56,715
The owner will be back by then
and you'll get your money.

705
00:53:05,480 --> 00:53:09,155
Is the anniversary
of his death close?

706
00:53:09,400 --> 00:53:10,879
Yes.

707
00:53:13,560 --> 00:53:17,439
But I can't leave right now.

708
00:53:17,960 --> 00:53:21,111
I'll go the day after tomorrow.

709
00:53:21,280 --> 00:53:22,918
Won't it be too late?

710
00:53:23,080 --> 00:53:25,275
No, it'll be the right time.

711
00:53:27,480 --> 00:53:28,959
Come on, kids.

712
00:53:29,160 --> 00:53:31,993
Don't stay here.
You're going to draw attention.

713
00:53:32,160 --> 00:53:34,549
I'll take care of it
after the holidays.

714
00:53:34,720 --> 00:53:36,551
I'll find the owner.

715
00:53:36,760 --> 00:53:39,069
The money's safe.
Nobody can take it.

716
00:53:39,240 --> 00:53:42,312
Go home now
or else your parents will get worried.

717
00:53:50,920 --> 00:53:53,229
We should've asked him
for the address.

718
00:53:54,120 --> 00:53:55,189
Whose address?

719
00:53:55,600 --> 00:53:58,160
I mean, the owner's address.

720
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:36,956
Wait here, I'll be back.

721
00:55:14,920 --> 00:55:15,875
What happened?

722
00:55:16,040 --> 00:55:18,713
It was a relative of his.
He might still be here.

723
00:55:18,880 --> 00:55:20,233
Wait.

724
00:55:21,280 --> 00:55:23,714
I want to ask you something.

725
00:55:23,960 --> 00:55:25,678
Does Mum know about this?

726
00:55:25,840 --> 00:55:27,273
Don't talk to me now

727
00:55:27,800 --> 00:55:31,349
or I'll forget the address.
I'll be right back.

728
00:56:32,200 --> 00:56:34,111
I don't see any money in there!

729
00:56:46,760 --> 00:56:48,637
It's a 500 note!

730
00:56:55,640 --> 00:56:58,916
Is that why you're so worried?

731
00:57:02,160 --> 00:57:06,915
Here, take some sunflower seeds.
I'll see if I can help you.

732
00:57:08,240 --> 00:57:09,719
Please take some.

733
00:57:10,520 --> 00:57:12,272
You don't want any?

734
00:57:12,480 --> 00:57:16,359
I also have some pastries
if you don't like those.

735
00:57:17,400 --> 00:57:18,879
Shall I open the box?

736
00:57:19,960 --> 00:57:22,110
It looks like
you don't want that either!

737
00:57:25,080 --> 00:57:27,116
What're you worrying about?

738
00:57:29,240 --> 00:57:31,629
I won't eat you or your money!

739
00:57:32,200 --> 00:57:34,236
So what're you scared of?

740
00:57:36,360 --> 00:57:41,912
I saw you were staring down there
and I thought I might help you!

741
00:57:45,080 --> 00:57:48,709
You shouldn't be scared of me.
I'm a nice guy!

742
00:57:51,400 --> 00:57:54,870
If you don't answer
I won't talk to you any more.

743
00:57:57,160 --> 00:58:01,551
But... I know
where the shop owner lives.

744
00:58:02,960 --> 00:58:05,918
He lives in that street
where your brother went.

745
00:58:07,200 --> 00:58:09,953
But your brother's not going
to find him. Know why?

746
00:58:11,360 --> 00:58:16,354
Because he's not home.
He's invited to my sister-in-law's!

747
00:58:16,960 --> 00:58:19,110
Your sister-in-law's?

748
00:58:21,800 --> 00:58:25,509
He might be there already
or still on his way.

749
00:58:25,680 --> 00:58:29,355
It's hard to say, because...

750
00:58:29,840 --> 00:58:32,957
her house is 700
or 800 kilometers away from here.

751
00:58:33,280 --> 00:58:34,599
You know...

752
00:58:35,280 --> 00:58:37,953
my little sister's your age.

753
00:58:39,000 --> 00:58:41,036
You're about 5, aren't you?

754
00:58:41,200 --> 00:58:42,872
Not at all. I'm 7.

755
00:58:44,360 --> 00:58:48,751
My sister is 5 years old, like you.
She doesn't go to school yet.

756
00:58:49,560 --> 00:58:52,597
Wrong again.
I'm 7 and I go to school.

757
00:58:52,760 --> 00:58:56,389
I'm in first grade
and also first in my class.

758
00:58:56,560 --> 00:58:59,757
I get A's all the time.
Now what do you say to that?

759
00:59:00,320 --> 00:59:02,038
My other sister's in third grade.

760
00:59:02,240 --> 00:59:04,515
She's also very good at school.

761
00:59:05,000 --> 00:59:08,993
But you look more like the one
who's 5 who doesn't go to school yet.

762
00:59:16,680 --> 00:59:17,476
What?

763
00:59:27,080 --> 00:59:28,399
What do you mean?

764
00:59:36,280 --> 00:59:37,793
My 2 sisters...

765
00:59:37,960 --> 00:59:41,270
One's a bit older than you
and the other one is a bit younger.

766
00:59:41,800 --> 00:59:44,234
I'm dying to see them.

767
00:59:45,800 --> 00:59:48,917
If you're dying to see them,
why don't you then?

768
00:59:49,120 --> 00:59:50,758
They live far away.

769
00:59:50,920 --> 00:59:52,717
- Where?
- In Neyshabour.

770
00:59:54,400 --> 00:59:58,916
You're from Neyshabour? Like
my Dad's friend, Mr. Neyshabouri.

771
00:59:59,080 --> 01:00:01,674
But he doesn't talk like you.

772
01:00:01,840 --> 01:00:05,071
He must've lived here
a long time then

773
01:00:05,240 --> 01:00:07,310
to have lost his accent.

774
01:00:07,480 --> 01:00:11,359
If I stayed here long enough,
I could also speak

775
01:00:11,560 --> 01:00:13,118
without an accent.

776
01:00:13,280 --> 01:00:15,077
How long have you been in Tehran?

777
01:00:15,240 --> 01:00:17,390
Around a year.

778
01:00:17,600 --> 01:00:19,238
When are you leaving?

779
01:00:19,400 --> 01:00:21,755
When I'm done in the army

780
01:00:22,280 --> 01:00:24,714
or when I get leave.

781
01:00:25,280 --> 01:00:29,910
Don't soldiers get a few days off
for New Year? The schools are closed!

782
01:00:30,080 --> 01:00:33,834
Even my Dad doesn't go to work.
Everybody is off for New Year.

783
01:00:34,040 --> 01:00:36,076
Nobody works.

784
01:00:36,920 --> 01:00:39,718
We get a few days off too,
but I decided not to go away.

785
01:00:39,920 --> 01:00:43,230
- I'll stay here.
- You lied about seeing your sisters.

786
01:00:44,240 --> 01:00:47,835
No, I didn't. Little missy...

787
01:00:48,440 --> 01:00:51,477
you're sulking again.
I didn't lie to you.

788
01:00:52,160 --> 01:00:53,878
I really want to see them.

789
01:00:54,040 --> 01:00:57,794
You want to go back home
to see them?

790
01:00:57,960 --> 01:00:59,279
I wanted to!

791
01:00:59,640 --> 01:01:03,713
When someone really wants to see his
family, it means he wants to go home.

792
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:05,956
You're right.

793
01:01:06,360 --> 01:01:07,952
You're on leave?

794
01:01:08,160 --> 01:01:11,550
That means that you could
leave your... school.

795
01:01:11,720 --> 01:01:13,551
No, I mean your...

796
01:01:14,520 --> 01:01:16,750
My work place is called a barracks.

797
01:01:17,280 --> 01:01:20,352
Why don't you leave
the barracks then?

798
01:01:20,520 --> 01:01:25,799
Tell me, how many days' leave
do you have?

799
01:01:25,960 --> 01:01:28,758
Our leave is also a week long,
like your Dad's.

800
01:01:28,920 --> 01:01:31,309
By the way,
what's your father's job?

801
01:01:34,120 --> 01:01:35,678
I don't know.

802
01:01:36,560 --> 01:01:38,915
You don't know
or you don't want to tell me?

803
01:01:39,520 --> 01:01:41,351
Maybe I don't want to tell you.

804
01:01:41,520 --> 01:01:45,308
You needn't if you don't want to.
But I'll answer all your questions.

805
01:01:47,240 --> 01:01:52,268
Why don't you go home to see your
sisters if you're dying to see them?

806
01:01:52,760 --> 01:01:54,591
Especially since you're on leave!

807
01:01:54,800 --> 01:01:56,233
Why don't you go?

808
01:01:56,400 --> 01:01:58,834
- You want to know why?
- Yes.

809
01:01:59,000 --> 01:02:01,195
Will you also tell me
your father's job?

810
01:02:04,640 --> 01:02:07,837
My father has 2 jobs. I'll tell you
one but not the other.

811
01:02:08,000 --> 01:02:11,788
My mother has told me
not to talk about his other job.

812
01:02:11,960 --> 01:02:15,509
His first job
is at the water company.

813
01:02:15,680 --> 01:02:18,513
He goes to every house
on his scooter

814
01:02:19,680 --> 01:02:21,272
and he reads the meter.

815
01:02:21,440 --> 01:02:24,557
You know, the paper you get

816
01:02:24,720 --> 01:02:28,713
to see how much you have to pay
for the water.

817
01:02:29,440 --> 01:02:31,237
But I won't tell you his other job.

818
01:02:31,400 --> 01:02:33,630
I also have 2 reasons for not going.

819
01:02:33,880 --> 01:02:37,839
I'll tell you the first one
but not the second... like you.

820
01:02:38,240 --> 01:02:43,314
The first reason is, I don't have
enough money for the bus fare.

821
01:02:45,000 --> 01:02:47,434
Plus, I have to buy presents

822
01:02:47,720 --> 01:02:49,790
for my 2 sisters

823
01:02:49,960 --> 01:02:53,635
and for my parents. I'd like to take
some presents with me.

824
01:02:53,880 --> 01:02:55,871
That's why I can't go.

825
01:02:56,160 --> 01:02:58,879
I'll try to work a bit
after my military service...

826
01:02:59,280 --> 01:03:01,316
before going back home.

827
01:03:02,400 --> 01:03:05,517
How much is the bus fare?

828
01:03:07,600 --> 01:03:10,273
There's a special price
for soldiers.

829
01:03:10,640 --> 01:03:12,631
Around 300 tomans.

830
01:03:12,800 --> 01:03:17,316
What would you have bought
for your sisters?

831
01:03:18,000 --> 01:03:20,673
I don't know.
Have you got any ideas?

832
01:03:22,240 --> 01:03:24,879
You could get them
some chewing gum

833
01:03:25,040 --> 01:03:27,600
or some chocolate maybe.

834
01:03:28,240 --> 01:03:31,471
No, not chocolate.
Wait, I have a better idea...

835
01:03:35,960 --> 01:03:39,635
Get them some of this.
Girls love it.

836
01:03:40,280 --> 01:03:43,158
It costs 7 tomans a piece.

837
01:03:43,320 --> 01:03:46,676
It'll cost 14 tomans for 2.

838
01:03:47,280 --> 01:03:49,236
Buy this for them.

839
01:03:50,760 --> 01:03:53,115
Can you go back with 400 tomans?

840
01:03:53,280 --> 01:03:56,192
Yes, I could with 400.

841
01:03:57,080 --> 01:03:58,718
Are you offering me your money?

842
01:04:00,240 --> 01:04:04,552
No, that's my mother's money.
She needs it for New Year.

843
01:04:04,880 --> 01:04:06,233
Oh, New Year!

844
01:04:06,400 --> 01:04:09,312
I'd totally forgotten about that.

845
01:04:09,480 --> 01:04:12,392
Then I have to bring them
some New Year's gifts as well.

846
01:04:12,840 --> 01:04:16,276
Now that you've given me
some ideas for the presents,

847
01:04:16,800 --> 01:04:20,554
take some of this sweetmeat.
And I'll try to take your money out.

848
01:04:21,760 --> 01:04:23,193
Why won't you take any?

849
01:04:24,240 --> 01:04:26,834
Were you told
not to take things from strangers?

850
01:04:27,000 --> 01:04:27,671
Yes.

851
01:04:27,840 --> 01:04:30,991
- And also not to talk to them.
- Yes.

852
01:04:31,160 --> 01:04:33,993
That's why you wouldn't talk
to me at first.

853
01:04:34,160 --> 01:04:35,229
Yes.

854
01:04:35,400 --> 01:04:38,153
It's true I don't know you,
but I'm not a stranger!

855
01:04:38,320 --> 01:04:40,709
How could you not know me
and not be a stranger?

856
01:04:40,880 --> 01:04:45,317
Well, I'm doing my military service
here, but I don't know anyone

857
01:04:45,480 --> 01:04:49,792
and nobody knows me either. I'm
a stranger, but I don't feel like one.

858
01:04:49,960 --> 01:04:52,713
What does that mean?

859
01:04:53,040 --> 01:04:57,431
When I first saw you,
I got the feeling we knew each other.

860
01:04:57,600 --> 01:05:01,149
So I came closer to talk to you.
I felt like your brother.

861
01:05:01,320 --> 01:05:04,915
All right, I'm not a stranger to you,

862
01:05:05,120 --> 01:05:07,953
but you don't have my brother's age!

863
01:05:08,120 --> 01:05:10,315
So you're a stranger to me.

864
01:05:10,520 --> 01:05:14,479
I was told not to accept things from
strangers and not to talk to them.

865
01:05:14,720 --> 01:05:17,712
Shall I tell my sisters
to do the same?

866
01:05:18,480 --> 01:05:21,950
Haven't you told them that before?

867
01:05:22,120 --> 01:05:26,079
No, because we live in a small village

868
01:05:26,680 --> 01:05:30,070
where people know each other.
There are no strangers back home.

869
01:05:30,840 --> 01:05:33,752
But here, people don't know
one another.

870
01:05:34,080 --> 01:05:37,629
They don't interact,
so they feel like strangers.

871
01:05:38,880 --> 01:05:40,279
Come here.

872
01:05:42,400 --> 01:05:47,315
- What were you blabbering about?
- We were talking about his sisters.

873
01:05:47,640 --> 01:05:49,995
Haven't you been told
not to talk to strangers?

874
01:05:50,160 --> 01:05:51,673
But he's not a stranger.

875
01:05:51,840 --> 01:05:53,159
What?

876
01:05:53,880 --> 01:05:56,110
He has a sister my age...

877
01:05:56,280 --> 01:05:59,078
A little bit younger
or a bit older...

878
01:05:59,360 --> 01:06:01,032
It's not the end of the world!

879
01:06:01,200 --> 01:06:04,510
Just wait till we get home
and you'll see.

880
01:06:07,360 --> 01:06:08,793
Listen...

881
01:06:09,520 --> 01:06:11,397
Your sister didn't talk to me.

882
01:06:11,560 --> 01:06:13,710
Of course I did!

883
01:06:13,880 --> 01:06:17,395
I'll show you when we get home!

884
01:06:17,600 --> 01:06:20,194
Don't scold her.
Here, take some of these.

885
01:06:25,000 --> 01:06:27,468
Well, I have to go back
to the barracks now.

886
01:06:27,960 --> 01:06:30,713
Don't be so sad, little girl.
Goodbye.

887
01:07:54,760 --> 01:07:56,671
They look great.

888
01:07:59,000 --> 01:08:00,194
What do?

889
01:08:00,360 --> 01:08:01,918
Your shoes.

890
01:08:02,600 --> 01:08:03,874
But they're not new.

891
01:08:04,040 --> 01:08:07,271
I know. But the polish is!

892
01:08:08,960 --> 01:08:12,509
- Did you find his house?
- Yes I did.

893
01:08:13,120 --> 01:08:16,192
- Was he home?
- Yes, but he was taking a shower.

894
01:08:17,240 --> 01:08:19,356
What shall we do
if he doesn't come?

895
01:08:19,520 --> 01:08:20,919
No idea.

896
01:08:23,720 --> 01:08:25,676
What do we do now?

897
01:08:26,200 --> 01:08:27,599
I don't know.

898
01:08:28,680 --> 01:08:31,990
I left him a message

899
01:08:32,360 --> 01:08:36,114
to come here after his shower.

900
01:08:36,840 --> 01:08:39,400
What if he were like Dad?

901
01:08:39,720 --> 01:08:42,234
Angry before the shower

902
01:08:42,520 --> 01:08:45,080
and sleepy afterwards!

903
01:08:45,280 --> 01:08:47,669
He wouldn't show up.
What will we do then?

904
01:08:47,960 --> 01:08:49,359
I don't know.

905
01:08:49,520 --> 01:08:54,036
If that shop was still open,
I would've taken the hook...

906
01:08:54,680 --> 01:08:57,672
and I would have twisted it
to take the money out.

907
01:08:57,840 --> 01:08:59,068
How?

908
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:02,912
I would've put
something sticky on the end.

909
01:09:29,200 --> 01:09:31,509
- Thief!
- Thief, yourself.

910
01:09:32,120 --> 01:09:34,839
- You stole my balloons.
- I didn't!

911
01:09:35,200 --> 01:09:36,599
I'll show you!

912
01:09:38,960 --> 01:09:40,552
Let my brother go.

913
01:09:42,920 --> 01:09:44,239
Leave him alone.

914
01:09:45,680 --> 01:09:48,513
I don't want the money any more.
Stop it!

915
01:09:49,800 --> 01:09:51,199
Let him go.

916
01:09:58,120 --> 01:10:00,509
- It was to get our money out.
- Which money?

917
01:10:01,000 --> 01:10:04,072
- The goldfish money.
- Look. Don't you have eyes?

918
01:10:04,480 --> 01:10:05,833
Get up, little brother.

919
01:10:20,400 --> 01:10:21,594
I don't see any money.

920
01:10:21,800 --> 01:10:25,713
Put your face down and if
you're not blind, you'll see it.

921
01:10:33,560 --> 01:10:35,437
Shade your eyes with your hands.

922
01:10:42,240 --> 01:10:43,878
Get away.

923
01:11:04,840 --> 01:11:06,478
Let me do it.

924
01:11:25,920 --> 01:11:26,909
There's no point.

925
01:11:30,080 --> 01:11:32,913
If we had something sticky,
it'd work.

926
01:11:33,440 --> 01:11:35,078
Like what?

927
01:11:35,520 --> 01:11:37,750
Like glue or chewing gum.

928
01:11:38,720 --> 01:11:40,233
Have you got any chewing gum?

929
01:11:41,200 --> 01:11:43,953
Where would I get it from?
Am I a chewing gum seller!

930
01:11:44,880 --> 01:11:45,915
What a cheek!

931
01:11:50,920 --> 01:11:53,753
- Do you have some change?
- I don't have a penny.

932
01:11:54,880 --> 01:11:56,154
Look in your pocket.

933
01:11:56,320 --> 01:11:59,312
- What for?
- Just do as I say.

934
01:11:59,520 --> 01:12:02,034
But I never keep money
in this pocket!

935
01:12:02,200 --> 01:12:04,634
Stop being a pain.

936
01:12:10,160 --> 01:12:13,197
Here, I always have
one of these in my pocket.

937
01:12:16,200 --> 01:12:19,510
Wait here.
I'll go get some chewing gum.

938
01:12:19,680 --> 01:12:21,591
I'm late. I have to sell my balloons.

939
01:12:21,760 --> 01:12:23,273
You can sell them here.

940
01:13:07,160 --> 01:13:09,549
- How much is this chewing gum?
- Which?

941
01:13:10,080 --> 01:13:11,638
5 tomans.

942
01:13:11,840 --> 01:13:13,273
Here's 10. Give me 5 back.

943
01:13:48,200 --> 01:13:51,158
- Where's the Afghan boy?
- Gone.

944
01:13:51,320 --> 01:13:52,719
Why did you let him go?

945
01:13:52,880 --> 01:13:54,438
He left on his own.

946
01:13:55,600 --> 01:13:57,989
But I didn't talk to him.

947
01:13:58,360 --> 01:14:00,191
Which way did he go?

948
01:14:01,520 --> 01:14:03,112
That way.

949
01:14:09,360 --> 01:14:12,193
- Did you buy any?
- No.

950
01:14:15,720 --> 01:14:17,597
Let's try with your fruit-roll.

951
01:14:17,760 --> 01:14:19,830
But we don't have a stick.

952
01:14:20,240 --> 01:14:23,391
You haven't eaten it, have you?
I bet you have.

953
01:14:32,360 --> 01:14:35,238
Here, take it.
I don't want it any more.

954
01:14:42,960 --> 01:14:45,235
Look, it's him!

955
01:14:51,960 --> 01:14:54,758
Where were you?
Give me your stick.

956
01:15:09,480 --> 01:15:11,357
Kids, I've bought chewing gum.

957
01:15:20,200 --> 01:15:22,031
Let's play a game.

958
01:15:52,200 --> 01:15:53,474
Stop!

959
01:15:53,640 --> 01:15:55,073
- I won.
- I did!

960
01:15:56,480 --> 01:15:57,629
No, I won the game.

961
01:16:16,320 --> 01:16:19,278
- Do you have it? Careful!
- Let me try.

962
01:16:20,960 --> 01:16:22,632
It's my turn now.

963
01:16:23,960 --> 01:16:26,235
- If you can't get it, it's my turn.
- OK.

964
01:16:33,640 --> 01:16:37,030
- Slowly.
- Careful! Oh, it fell again.

965
01:16:37,240 --> 01:16:38,116
My turn.

966
01:16:38,320 --> 01:16:39,992
Once more. Then, you try.

967
01:16:48,160 --> 01:16:50,549
- You don't do it right.
- Let me try.

968
01:16:52,320 --> 01:16:53,469
What's up?

969
01:17:03,800 --> 01:17:04,869
What's going on here?

970
01:17:10,720 --> 01:17:12,551
Our money has fallen down here.

971
01:17:12,720 --> 01:17:14,790
- Which money?
- My sister's money.

972
01:17:15,680 --> 01:17:18,353
Is that why you made me
come here on New Year's Eve?

973
01:17:19,040 --> 01:17:20,189
Is this your shop?

974
01:17:20,600 --> 01:17:22,352
Yes and what can I do for you?

975
01:17:23,200 --> 01:17:25,873
Is it possible to get our money out?

976
01:17:26,040 --> 01:17:29,112
Your telephone
kept ringing non-stop.

977
01:17:29,280 --> 01:17:31,191
You should've answered

978
01:17:32,000 --> 01:17:33,831
to see if it was
what's-his-name.

979
01:17:48,840 --> 01:17:51,673
- Give it to me.
- Here, take it.

980
01:17:57,000 --> 01:17:58,831
Here's your stick.

981
01:17:59,360 --> 01:18:02,193
Goodbye, sir.
Come on, what are you waiting for?

982
01:18:02,360 --> 01:18:05,591
Why did you make me come
if you could do it yourselves?

983
01:18:07,920 --> 01:18:12,471
The sea is rough, brother,
the sea is rough...

984
01:18:12,640 --> 01:18:14,949
Is the sea still rough, my friend?

985
01:18:16,280 --> 01:18:18,794
Time to go home now.

986
01:18:21,640 --> 01:18:23,517
Do you have matches?

987
01:18:23,720 --> 01:18:26,473
Why should I have matches?
I'm not a matchseller!

988
01:18:29,720 --> 01:18:31,551
Do you have a match?

989
01:18:32,480 --> 01:18:34,550
You didn't shut it.

990
01:18:35,360 --> 01:18:37,669
I would've told you,
had I not shut it.

991
01:18:52,600 --> 01:18:56,070
Did you find your money, little girl?

992
01:18:56,360 --> 01:18:57,315
Yes, we did.

993
01:18:57,480 --> 01:19:01,359
And you bought your fish. See?
No point crying. Happy New Year.

994
01:19:01,520 --> 01:19:03,476
Happy New Year to you too.

995
01:19:03,840 --> 01:19:05,910
Are you coming?
What're you waiting for?

996
01:19:23,400 --> 01:19:29,316
Year 1374 of the solar calendar
has just begun...
