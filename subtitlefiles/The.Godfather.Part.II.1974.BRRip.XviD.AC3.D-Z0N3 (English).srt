1
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:57,957
They've killed the boy!
They've killed young Paolo!

2
00:02:58,240 --> 00:03:01,835
They've killed your son Paolo!

3
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:04,191
Murderers! Murderers!

4
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:15,999
My son...

5
00:03:58,600 --> 00:04:00,830
All my respect, Don Ciccio.

6
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:08,788
You killed my husband because
he wouldn't give in to you.

7
00:04:09,320 --> 00:04:11,550
And his oldest son Paolo...

8
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:14,675
...because he swore revenge.

9
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:19,276
But Vito is only nine.
And dumb-witted.

10
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:21,673
He never speaks.

11
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,355
It's not his words I'm afraid of.

12
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:29,229
He's weak. He couldn't hurt anyone.

13
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,639
But when he grows, he'll grow strong.

14
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:36,550
Don't worry. This little boy
can't do a thing to you.

15
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:47,117
When he's a man, he'll
come for revenge.

16
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:52,833
I beg you, Don Ciccio,
spare my only son.

17
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:55,471
He's all I have left.

18
00:04:55,800 --> 00:05:00,669
I swear to God he'll never do
you any harm. Spare him!

19
00:05:09,640 --> 00:05:10,595
Vito, run!

20
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:11,709
Move and I'll kill him!

21
00:05:13,640 --> 00:05:15,039
Run, Vito!

22
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:21,749
Kill him!

23
00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:35,117
Any family who hides the boy
Vito Andolini will regret it!

24
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:38,508
You understand?

25
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:52,151
Anybody who hides the boy
Vito Andolini is in for trouble!

26
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:19,270
Vito, we're praying for you!

27
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:28,149
If anyone is hiding the boy
Vito Andolini...

28
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:30,958
...turn him over to us.

29
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:34,314
Don Ciccio will thank you for it!

30
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:38,478
It'll be better for the boy,
and better for you!

31
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:54,477
Any family who hides the boy
Vito Andolini will regret it!

32
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:25,758
Nurse.

33
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:52,392
Money?

34
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:55,511
Interpreter!

35
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:03,909
Where are you from?

36
00:09:04,280 --> 00:09:06,236
- What is your name?
- Maria.

37
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:12,556
What is your name?

38
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:16,712
Come on, son. What is your name?

39
00:09:19,880 --> 00:09:22,678
Vito Andolini from Corleone.

40
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:25,948
Corleone. Vito Corleone.

41
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:28,948
Okay, over there.

42
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:30,995
Next.

43
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:44,232
Tell him he has smallpox.
Quarantine three months.

44
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:55,029
Vito Corleone!

45
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:57,990
Vito Corleone!

46
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:02,035
Here he is. This is him.

47
00:11:44,280 --> 00:11:46,316
Did you bring the car keys?

48
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:50,788
Laurie! Laurie!

49
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:12,436
Mama!

50
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:15,112
Mama!

51
00:12:17,080 --> 00:12:19,594
- Look who's here.
- Father Carmelo.

52
00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:22,792
- This is Father Carmelo.
- I'm Merle Johnson.

53
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:26,392
Mama!

54
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:31,359
- Here I am.
- Constanzia, after one week?

55
00:12:31,480 --> 00:12:35,314
I sent the car to the airport last week
to pick you up.

56
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:41,117
It was chaos. Anyway, here I am, just
one week late. This is for my mama!

57
00:12:41,240 --> 00:12:44,232
- What is this?
- You remember Merle?

58
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:47,000
Hello. How are you? Thank you.

59
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:52,433
Where's Michael? I've got to talk to him
and I can't wait on line.

60
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:54,790
You go see your children first.

61
00:12:54,920 --> 00:13:00,278
Then you worry about waiting on line to
see your brother. Like everybody else.

62
00:13:04,920 --> 00:13:07,275
<i>Ladies and gentlemen...</i>

63
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:11,240
<i>A most distinguished guest
would like to say a few words.</i>

64
00:13:11,560 --> 00:13:15,439
<i>Please welcome Senator Pat Geary
of the State of Nevada.</i>

65
00:13:15,560 --> 00:13:18,199
<i>And there is Mrs Geary.</i>

66
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,116
<i>Thank you very much.</i>

67
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:36,714
<i>This is a very, very happy day
for me and my wife Mrs Geary.</i>

68
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:40,312
<i>We see Nevada far too seldom.</i>

69
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:45,150
<i>But today we can join with old friends,
we can make new friends</i>

70
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:48,955
<i>and we help celebrate
a young man's first Communion.</i>

71
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:56,399
<i>And also to thank that boy's family for
a magnificent contribution to the State.</i>

72
00:13:56,520 --> 00:14:02,038
<i>I have here in my hand a cheque
made out to the university</i>

73
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:06,756
<i>and it is a magnificent endowment
in the name of</i>

74
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:10,754
<i>Anthony Vito Corleone.</i>

75
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:14,758
<i>The cheque is signed by
that young man's parents</i>

76
00:14:14,960 --> 00:14:17,554
<i>whom I think we should recognise.</i>

77
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:21,878
<i>Mike, Pat, Kay, stand up, please.
Let the folks see you!</i>

78
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,911
<i>Folks, I want you to join me</i>

79
00:14:24,040 --> 00:14:29,558
<i>in giving a real Nevada thank you
to Mr and Mrs Michael Corleone!</i>

80
00:14:35,240 --> 00:14:40,314
<i>We also have, as a special added
attraction, the Sierra Boys Choir</i>

81
00:14:40,520 --> 00:14:46,550
<i>who have chosen a certain special song
and a special arrangement</i>

82
00:14:46,680 --> 00:14:50,468
<i>to honour their host,
Mr Michael Corleone.</i>

83
00:14:50,680 --> 00:14:52,079
<i>Boys.</i>

84
00:15:07,960 --> 00:15:09,951
The plaque.

85
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:12,549
Okay, fellows, did you get that one?

86
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:15,431
Okay, that's good.

87
00:15:15,640 --> 00:15:19,474
Now, Senator,
just you and Mrs Corleone.

88
00:15:40,120 --> 00:15:42,953
My lawyer Tom Hagen. Senator Geary.

89
00:15:43,160 --> 00:15:46,152
He arranged everything
through your man Turnbull.

90
00:15:46,360 --> 00:15:49,272
- Yes, yes.
- Sit down.

91
00:15:52,360 --> 00:15:55,636
I thought that you and I
would talk alone.

92
00:15:57,040 --> 00:16:02,592
I trust these men with my life, Senator.
To ask them to leave would be an insult.

93
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:05,518
Well, it's perfectly all right with me

94
00:16:05,640 --> 00:16:10,077
but I am a blunt man and I intend
to speak very frankly to you.

95
00:16:10,280 --> 00:16:12,077
Maybe more frankly

96
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:15,351
than anyone in my position
has ever talked to you before.

97
00:16:15,560 --> 00:16:18,393
The Corleone family
has done well in Nevada.

98
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:23,469
You own, or control,
two major hotels in Vegas

99
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:27,912
and one in Reno.
The licences were grandfathered in

100
00:16:28,040 --> 00:16:31,271
so there was no problem
with the Gaming Commission.

101
00:16:33,240 --> 00:16:36,073
Now my sources tell me

102
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:40,079
that you plan to make a move
against the Tropigala.

103
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:45,035
They tell me that within a week,
you're going to move Klingman out.

104
00:16:45,160 --> 00:16:50,598
Quite an expansion. However, it will
leave you with a little technical problem.

105
00:16:53,280 --> 00:16:55,999
The licence will still be
in Klingman's name.

106
00:16:57,040 --> 00:17:01,352
- Turnbull is a good man.
- Yeah, well, let's cut out the bullshit.

107
00:17:01,480 --> 00:17:04,517
I don't want to spend
more time here than I have to.

108
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:06,949
You can have the licence.

109
00:17:07,080 --> 00:17:09,753
The price is 250,000 dollars.

110
00:17:09,880 --> 00:17:12,394
Plus five per cent of the gross monthly

111
00:17:12,520 --> 00:17:16,798
of all four hotels, Mr Corleone.

112
00:17:20,280 --> 00:17:24,990
The price for the licence
is less than 20,000 dollars, right?

113
00:17:25,120 --> 00:17:27,350
That's right.

114
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:32,759
- Why would I pay more than that?
- Because I intend to squeeze you.

115
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:35,394
I don't like your kind of people.

116
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:40,753
I don't like to see you come out
to this clean country in oily hair

117
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:43,110
dressed up in those silk suits

118
00:17:43,240 --> 00:17:46,994
and try to pass yourselves off
as decent Americans.

119
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:52,513
I'll do business with you, but the fact is
that I despise your masquerade,

120
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:57,839
the dishonest way you pose yourself
and your whole fucking family.

121
00:18:05,080 --> 00:18:06,798
Senator,

122
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:10,958
we're both part of the same hypocrisy.

123
00:18:12,280 --> 00:18:15,590
But never think it applies to my family.

124
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:18,595
All right, all right.

125
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:24,309
Some people have to play little games.
You play yours.

126
00:18:26,360 --> 00:18:30,273
Let's say that you'll pay me
because it's in your interest.

127
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:35,198
I want your answer and the money
by noon tomorrow. One more thing.

128
00:18:35,320 --> 00:18:38,710
Don't you contact me again, ever.

129
00:18:38,840 --> 00:18:42,469
From now on you deal with Turnbull.
Open that door, son.

130
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:46,629
Senator, you can have my answer now
if you like.

131
00:18:49,160 --> 00:18:51,833
My offer is this...

132
00:18:52,040 --> 00:18:53,519
Nothing.

133
00:18:55,200 --> 00:19:00,558
Not even the fee for the gaming licence,
which I would like you to put up.

134
00:19:05,800 --> 00:19:08,109
Good afternoon, gentlemen.

135
00:19:10,560 --> 00:19:13,154
Ladies! I didn't know you were out here.

136
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:16,158
- Honey, we have to go.
- Really? I'm sorry.

137
00:19:16,360 --> 00:19:19,511
- It's been delightful.
- It was our pleasure.

138
00:19:19,720 --> 00:19:22,188
It was wonderful talking to you.

139
00:20:04,920 --> 00:20:09,869
Fredo! Fredo, you son-of-a-bitch,
you look great!

140
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,797
Frank Pentangeli!

141
00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:14,912
I thought you was
never coming out west, you big bum!

142
00:20:15,920 --> 00:20:18,514
I've got to check on my boys.

143
00:20:19,680 --> 00:20:21,557
- What's with the food here?
- What's the matter?

144
00:20:21,680 --> 00:20:27,232
A kid gives me a Ritz cracker
with chopped liver and says, "canapés".

145
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:32,389
I said, "Can of peas, my ass. That's
a Ritz cracker and chopped liver!"

146
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:38,558
Bring out the peppers and sardines!

147
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:42,317
Seeing you reminds me of New York
in the old days!

148
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:48,753
You remember Willi Cicci, who was
with old man Clemenza in Brooklyn?

149
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:54,231
We were all upset about that.
Heart attack, huh?

150
00:20:54,360 --> 00:20:57,272
No, that was no heart attack.

151
00:20:57,640 --> 00:21:01,428
That's what I'm here to see
your brother Mike about.

152
00:21:01,560 --> 00:21:04,472
- But what's with him?
- What do you mean?

153
00:21:04,600 --> 00:21:09,720
Do I have to get a letter of introduction
to get a sit-down?

154
00:21:09,920 --> 00:21:14,232
- You can't get in to see Mike?
- He's got me waiting in a lobby!

155
00:21:17,800 --> 00:21:20,712
- Johnny Ola.
- Al Neri.

156
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:31,153
- Do you know my lawyer Tom Hagen?
- I remember Tom from the old days.

157
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:32,759
Rocco.

158
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:36,589
- What's this?
- It's an orange from Miami.

159
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:39,632
Take care of Johnny's men.
They look like they might be hungry.

160
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:40,715
Johnny?

161
00:21:43,680 --> 00:21:47,639
Tom won't stay. He only handles
specific areas of the business.

162
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:50,471
Sure, Mike.

163
00:21:54,560 --> 00:21:57,711
- What are you drinking, Johnny?
- Anisette.

164
00:22:02,680 --> 00:22:07,629
- If you need anything, I'll be outside.
- Just tell Rocco we're waiting, Tom.

165
00:22:12,560 --> 00:22:16,599
- I just left Mr Roth in Miami.
- How is his health?

166
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:18,517
It's not good.

167
00:22:19,720 --> 00:22:22,075
Can I do anything or send anything?

168
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:26,830
He appreciates your concern, Michael,
and your respect.

169
00:22:27,160 --> 00:22:28,752
That casino...

170
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:33,317
Registered owners. Jacob Lawrence,
Allan Barclay. Beverly Hills attorneys.

171
00:22:34,360 --> 00:22:37,113
The real owners are
the old Lakeville Road group

172
00:22:37,240 --> 00:22:39,390
and our friend in Miami.

173
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:45,277
Klingman runs it and owns a piece of
it too, but I've been instructed to tell you

174
00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:49,279
that if you move him out,
our friend in Miami will go along.

175
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:55,957
It's very kind of him.
Tell him it's greatly appreciated.

176
00:22:57,120 --> 00:23:00,795
Hyman Roth always makes money
for his partners.

177
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:05,710
One by one, our old friends are gone.

178
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:09,391
Death, natural or not,

179
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:12,114
prison, deported...

180
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:18,594
Only Hyman Roth is left, because he
always made money for his partners.

181
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:25,678
I can't believe it! Out of 30 professional
musicians there isn't one Italian!

182
00:23:25,800 --> 00:23:28,314
Let's have a tarantella!

183
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:35,716
You! Up, up, up!

184
00:23:45,040 --> 00:23:46,439
<i>Questa mano!</i>

185
00:23:47,640 --> 00:23:49,471
<i>Questa mano!</i>

186
00:23:54,920 --> 00:23:57,878
What the hell have we here?

187
00:24:08,440 --> 00:24:13,878
- I'll see my sister alone.
- It concerns me too. May I stay?

188
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:17,959
How are you, honey? You've met
Merle, he was with me in Vegas.

189
00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:21,072
- I saw him with you.
- Could I have a drink?

190
00:24:25,480 --> 00:24:27,675
Al, please get him a drink!

191
00:24:29,960 --> 00:24:33,555
<i>We're going to Europe. I'd like to book
passage on The Queen.</i>

192
00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:36,399
Why don't you go to a travel agent?

193
00:24:36,520 --> 00:24:39,318
We're getting married first.

194
00:24:46,760 --> 00:24:50,719
The ink on your divorce isn't dry yet,
and you're getting married?

195
00:24:53,040 --> 00:24:55,395
You see your children on weekends.

196
00:24:55,520 --> 00:25:00,230
Your oldest boy was picked up in Reno
for a theft you don't even know about.

197
00:25:00,360 --> 00:25:03,511
You fly around the world
with men who use you!

198
00:25:03,640 --> 00:25:06,029
- You're not my father!
- So why come to me?

199
00:25:06,160 --> 00:25:07,479
I need money.

200
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:22,994
Connie, Connie, Connie...

201
00:25:29,400 --> 00:25:31,789
I want to be reasonable with you.

202
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:35,474
Why don't you stay with the family?

203
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:39,154
You can live on the estate
with your kids.

204
00:25:39,280 --> 00:25:42,716
You won't be deprived of anything.

205
00:25:47,040 --> 00:25:52,239
I don't know this Merle. I don't know
what he does or what he lives on.

206
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:58,515
Tell him marriage is out of the question
and you don't want to see him any more.

207
00:25:58,680 --> 00:26:00,716
He'll understand, believe me.

208
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:10,391
Connie.

209
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:16,279
If you don't listen to me
and marry this man,

210
00:26:20,520 --> 00:26:22,715
you'll disappoint me.

211
00:26:53,040 --> 00:26:56,999
<i>- Famiglia!
- Cent'anni!</i>

212
00:26:57,720 --> 00:26:59,676
What's "Chen dannay"?

213
00:26:59,800 --> 00:27:02,633
"Cent' anni". It means 100 years.

214
00:27:02,760 --> 00:27:06,833
It means we should all live happily
for 100 years. The family.

215
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:10,839
- It would be true if my father were alive.
- Connie.

216
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:12,439
Hey...

217
00:27:12,560 --> 00:27:16,155
Merle, you've met my sister-in-law,
Deanna.

218
00:27:16,280 --> 00:27:17,838
- Fredo's wife.
- My pleasure.

219
00:27:28,160 --> 00:27:31,789
With all respect, I didn't
come here to eat dinner!

220
00:27:32,560 --> 00:27:33,959
I know, I know.

221
00:28:03,120 --> 00:28:07,955
- I just want to dance!
- You're falling all over the floor.

222
00:28:08,160 --> 00:28:11,709
You're just jealous
because he's a real man!

223
00:28:11,920 --> 00:28:16,391
- I'm going to belt you right in the teeth.
- You couldn't belt your mama!

224
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:20,276
These Dagos are crazy
when it comes to their wives.

225
00:28:20,400 --> 00:28:25,076
Michael says that if you can't
take care of this, I have to.

226
00:28:25,280 --> 00:28:27,953
- I think you'd better.
- Never marry a Wop.

227
00:28:28,160 --> 00:28:33,393
They treat their wives like shit!
I didn't mean to say Wop. Don't!

228
00:28:34,400 --> 00:28:39,428
What are you doing to me,
you big slob? Help!

229
00:28:39,560 --> 00:28:40,675
Fredo!

230
00:28:40,800 --> 00:28:45,396
- I can't control her, Mikey.
- You're my brother, don't apologise.

231
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:53,079
Clemenza promised the Rosato
brothers three territories after he died.

232
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:54,553
You took over and didn't give it to them.

233
00:28:54,680 --> 00:28:55,874
I welched.

234
00:28:56,000 --> 00:29:00,232
<i>Clemenza promised them lu cazzo.
He promised them nothing.</i>

235
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:05,715
- He hated them more than I do.
- Frankie, they feel cheated.

236
00:29:06,560 --> 00:29:10,599
You're sitting up in the Sierra Mountains
and you're drinking...

237
00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:12,915
- What's he drinking?
- Champagne.

238
00:29:13,120 --> 00:29:17,910
Champagne cocktails, and passing
judgement on how I run my family.

239
00:29:20,040 --> 00:29:21,712
Your family's still called Corleone.

240
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:25,792
And you'll run it like a Corleone.

241
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:29,710
My family doesn't eat here,
doesn't eat in Las Vegas...

242
00:29:30,280 --> 00:29:31,793
...and doesn't eat in Miami...

243
00:29:32,320 --> 00:29:33,878
...with Hyman Roth!

244
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:44,312
You're a good old man and I like you.

245
00:29:44,440 --> 00:29:46,715
You were loyal to my father for years.

246
00:29:48,320 --> 00:29:52,108
The Rosato brothers
are taking hostages.

247
00:29:53,360 --> 00:29:58,912
They spit right in my face, all because
they're backed up by that Jew in Miami.

248
00:29:59,040 --> 00:30:01,759
I know. That's why
I don't want them touched.

249
00:30:01,960 --> 00:30:05,555
- Not touched?
- No, I want you to be fair with them.

250
00:30:05,680 --> 00:30:10,435
You want me to be fair with them?
How can you be fair to animals?

251
00:30:10,640 --> 00:30:16,556
Tom, listen. They recruit spics,
they recruit niggers.

252
00:30:16,680 --> 00:30:20,229
They do violence in their grandmothers'
neighbourhoods!

253
00:30:20,360 --> 00:30:26,515
And everything with them is whores!
And junk, dope!

254
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:29,200
And they leave the gambling to last.

255
00:30:29,320 --> 00:30:34,235
I want to run my family without you
on my back. I want those Rosatos dead!

256
00:30:34,360 --> 00:30:37,033
<i>- No.
- Morte.</i>

257
00:30:42,520 --> 00:30:47,116
I have business that's important with
Hyman Roth. I don't want it disturbed.

258
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:53,073
Then you give your loyalty to a Jew
before your own blood.

259
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:59,959
You know my father did business
with Hyman Roth. He respected him.

260
00:31:00,080 --> 00:31:04,471
Your father did business with
Hyman Roth, he respected Hyman Roth,

261
00:31:04,600 --> 00:31:07,592
but he never trusted Hyman Roth

262
00:31:07,720 --> 00:31:10,996
or his Sicilian messenger boy,
Johnny Ola.

263
00:31:11,320 --> 00:31:16,348
You'll have to excuse me. I'm tired,
and I'm a little drunk!

264
00:31:18,560 --> 00:31:23,429
I want everybody here to know, there's
not going to be no trouble from me!

265
00:31:23,880 --> 00:31:25,598
Don Corleone.

266
00:31:25,800 --> 00:31:27,631
Cicci, the door...

267
00:31:35,720 --> 00:31:37,676
You want him to leave now?

268
00:31:40,160 --> 00:31:44,438
Let him go back to New York.
I've already made my plans.

269
00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:47,954
The old man had too much wine.

270
00:31:52,040 --> 00:31:54,190
It's late.

271
00:32:05,560 --> 00:32:07,471
How's the baby?

272
00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:11,798
- Sleeping inside me.
- Does it feel like a boy?

273
00:32:11,920 --> 00:32:14,878
Yes, it does, Michael.

274
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:18,592
Kay?

275
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:23,077
I'm sorry about all the people today.
Bad timing.

276
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:25,395
It couldn't be helped, though.

277
00:32:25,520 --> 00:32:28,592
It made me think
of what you once told me.

278
00:32:30,560 --> 00:32:34,439
"In five years the Corleone family
will be completely legitimate."

279
00:32:34,560 --> 00:32:37,279
That was seven years ago.

280
00:32:39,840 --> 00:32:43,310
I know. I'm trying, darling.

281
00:33:44,680 --> 00:33:47,274
Did you see this?

282
00:34:00,440 --> 00:34:02,351
Why are the drapes open?

283
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:30,752
Kay, are you all right?

284
00:34:30,880 --> 00:34:33,394
- Are you hit?
- No.

285
00:34:35,680 --> 00:34:36,739
It's all right.

286
00:34:36,774 --> 00:34:37,798
It's all right.

287
00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:41,475
Stop! Stop!

288
00:34:43,080 --> 00:34:44,638
Halt!

289
00:34:55,200 --> 00:34:58,795
They're still on the property.
Please stay inside.

290
00:34:58,920 --> 00:35:00,911
- Keep them alive.
- We'll try.

291
00:35:01,040 --> 00:35:02,473
Alive!

292
00:35:03,600 --> 00:35:05,556
Stay by the door.

293
00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:23,636
Yeah, come in.

294
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:33,153
- Mike, are you all right?
- Yeah.

295
00:36:37,320 --> 00:36:39,993
There's a lot I can't tell you, Tom.

296
00:36:41,680 --> 00:36:44,911
And I know that's upset you in the past.

297
00:36:46,040 --> 00:36:49,999
You felt it was because of
some lack of trust or confidence.

298
00:36:51,200 --> 00:36:55,876
But it's because I admire you
and love you

299
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:58,639
that I kept things secret from you.

300
00:37:00,320 --> 00:37:03,073
Now you're the only one I can trust.

301
00:37:05,840 --> 00:37:07,592
Fredo?

302
00:37:07,720 --> 00:37:10,154
Well, he's got a good heart.

303
00:37:10,280 --> 00:37:14,637
But he's weak and he's stupid,
and this is life and death.

304
00:37:15,480 --> 00:37:18,517
Tom, you're my brother.

305
00:37:23,880 --> 00:37:28,908
I always wanted to be thought of as
a brother by you, Mikey. A real brother.

306
00:37:31,480 --> 00:37:33,436
I know that.

307
00:37:39,320 --> 00:37:41,231
You're going to take over.

308
00:37:42,280 --> 00:37:44,396
You're going to be the Don.

309
00:37:47,240 --> 00:37:52,473
If what I think has happened,
has happened, I'm leaving here tonight.

310
00:37:53,320 --> 00:37:59,111
I give you complete power. Over Fredo
and his men. Rocco, Neri, everyone.

311
00:38:00,840 --> 00:38:04,276
I'm trusting you
with the lives of my wife

312
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:07,278
and my children,
the future of this family.

313
00:38:10,680 --> 00:38:15,276
- If we catch them, will we find out...
- We won't catch them.

314
00:38:17,360 --> 00:38:20,557
Unless I'm very wrong,
they're dead already.

315
00:38:22,040 --> 00:38:25,112
They were killed by somebody
close to us.

316
00:38:25,320 --> 00:38:29,632
Inside. Very, very frightened
that they botched it.

317
00:38:30,040 --> 00:38:34,113
You don't think that Rocco and Neri
had something to do with this?

318
00:38:37,560 --> 00:38:41,678
See... All our people are businessmen.

319
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:46,158
Their loyalty is based on that.

320
00:38:48,240 --> 00:38:50,800
One thing I learnt from Pop

321
00:38:52,280 --> 00:38:55,590
was to try to think
as people around you think.

322
00:38:57,440 --> 00:39:00,193
On that basis, anything is possible.

323
00:39:02,080 --> 00:39:05,675
Mike, they're dead!
Right outside my window!

324
00:39:05,880 --> 00:39:08,872
I want to get out of here.
They're lying there dead!

325
00:39:19,520 --> 00:39:22,159
Over here! There's two of them.

326
00:39:22,360 --> 00:39:26,319
Looks like they were hired
out of New York. I don't recognise them.

327
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:29,833
Won't get anything out of them now.

328
00:39:29,960 --> 00:39:31,951
Fish them out.

329
00:39:55,320 --> 00:39:57,550
Get rid of the bodies.

330
00:39:57,760 --> 00:40:00,558
- Where's Mike?
- Rocco.

331
00:40:29,320 --> 00:40:34,394
Anthony, everything is going to be
all right. Try to sleep.

332
00:40:49,880 --> 00:40:54,237
- Did you like your party?
- I got lots of presents.

333
00:40:54,440 --> 00:40:57,591
I know. Did you like them?

334
00:40:57,800 --> 00:41:00,917
Yeah. I didn't know the people
who gave them to me.

335
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:04,113
Well, they were friends.

336
00:41:05,880 --> 00:41:10,112
- Did you see my present for you?
- It was on my pillow.

337
00:41:12,560 --> 00:41:15,552
I'm going to be leaving
very early tomorrow.

338
00:41:16,400 --> 00:41:20,518
- Will you take me?
- No, I can't, Anthony.

339
00:41:20,720 --> 00:41:25,316
- Why do you have to go?
- I have to do business.

340
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:28,958
I could help you.

341
00:41:31,280 --> 00:41:34,238
I know. Some day you will.

342
00:41:35,480 --> 00:41:37,471
Get some sleep.

343
00:42:50,760 --> 00:42:53,752
She's really beautiful.
You've got to see her.

344
00:43:13,480 --> 00:43:17,632
Wait till you see her.
Words can't describe her.

345
00:43:26,840 --> 00:43:30,389
I left Naples. I left Mama.

346
00:43:31,680 --> 00:43:33,398
For a no-good tramp!

347
00:43:35,320 --> 00:43:39,472
Now here I am in America,
in New York.

348
00:43:41,640 --> 00:43:44,712
Alone! Thinking of my mother.

349
00:43:47,040 --> 00:43:48,712
Without news from home.

350
00:43:57,440 --> 00:43:59,271
Finally, a letter from Naples!

351
00:44:02,240 --> 00:44:04,959
Vito, how do you like my little angel?
Isn't she beautiful?

352
00:44:05,920 --> 00:44:07,717
She's very beautiful.

353
00:44:09,600 --> 00:44:12,990
To you, she's beautiful. For me,
there's only my wife and son.

354
00:44:14,040 --> 00:44:15,439
Our dear mother -

355
00:44:17,720 --> 00:44:19,631
...is dead!

356
00:45:13,960 --> 00:45:16,713
We'll go backstage later
and take her to eat.

357
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:22,877
Sit down, you bum!

358
00:45:29,400 --> 00:45:31,277
Oh, excuse me, Don Fanucci.

359
00:45:38,960 --> 00:45:41,030
We'll go see her backstage.

360
00:45:43,880 --> 00:45:45,393
Who was that?

361
00:45:46,360 --> 00:45:47,873
The Black Hand.

362
00:46:19,160 --> 00:46:21,390
That's Fanucci... the Black Hand.

363
00:46:21,920 --> 00:46:23,751
We'll talk about it tomorrow.

364
00:46:25,040 --> 00:46:27,793
Tomorrow! Always tomorrow!

365
00:46:28,880 --> 00:46:30,359
You'll pay me today!

366
00:46:40,320 --> 00:46:41,878
Let's go.

367
00:46:45,080 --> 00:46:47,071
Not my daughter! Let her go!

368
00:46:48,520 --> 00:46:50,511
Here, take all my money!

369
00:46:58,520 --> 00:47:00,715
Vito, come on.

370
00:47:06,920 --> 00:47:10,037
I know what you're thinking. But
you don't know how things are.

371
00:47:10,680 --> 00:47:13,877
Fanucci's with the Black Hand.
The whole neighbourhood pays him.

372
00:47:14,560 --> 00:47:16,232
Even my father, in the grocery store.

373
00:47:16,360 --> 00:47:17,679
If he's Italian...

374
00:47:19,680 --> 00:47:21,989
...why does he bother other Italians?

375
00:47:22,120 --> 00:47:24,395
He knows they have nobody
to protect them.

376
00:47:24,960 --> 00:47:26,552
Forget that. Did you like my angel?

377
00:47:26,760 --> 00:47:28,478
If you're happy, I'm happy.

378
00:48:14,760 --> 00:48:16,478
Don't you feel well?

379
00:48:20,480 --> 00:48:22,152
Is your boss treating you all right?

380
00:48:24,120 --> 00:48:25,758
Forget it.

381
00:48:38,160 --> 00:48:40,993
Hey, you speak Italian?

382
00:48:46,400 --> 00:48:47,799
Hide this for me!

383
00:48:48,400 --> 00:48:50,356
Next week I'll come and get it!

384
00:49:28,600 --> 00:49:30,636
Abbandando, meet my nephew!

385
00:49:35,520 --> 00:49:37,351
How's business?

386
00:49:43,400 --> 00:49:45,231
It's good, it's good.

387
00:49:51,800 --> 00:49:54,872
Fanucci's mad. Says the
neighbourhood's getting sloppy.

388
00:49:55,200 --> 00:49:58,875
People don't pay on time,
don't pay the full amount.

389
00:49:59,160 --> 00:50:01,230
Says he's been too nice to everyone.

390
00:50:07,160 --> 00:50:09,037
So Fanucci's changing?

391
00:50:09,520 --> 00:50:11,750
Sure. He wants double
from everybody.

392
00:50:12,880 --> 00:50:14,791
Even from my father.

393
00:50:15,360 --> 00:50:18,716
I'm a friend, right? So you'll
let him work here?

394
00:50:49,880 --> 00:50:51,677
I've got some bad news.

395
00:50:56,080 --> 00:50:58,196
I feel rotten about telling you this...

396
00:51:01,040 --> 00:51:04,715
But Fanucci... he's got a nephew...

397
00:51:12,200 --> 00:51:13,952
And you have to give him my job.

398
00:51:14,920 --> 00:51:18,037
You've always been good to me,
ever since I came here.

399
00:51:19,240 --> 00:51:21,231
You looked after me like a father.

400
00:51:21,720 --> 00:51:23,039
I thank you.

401
00:51:24,520 --> 00:51:26,476
And I won't forget it.

402
00:51:39,400 --> 00:51:41,197
Vito!

403
00:51:45,400 --> 00:51:46,913
Oh, no!

404
00:51:48,320 --> 00:51:50,231
Take this to your family.

405
00:51:52,440 --> 00:51:54,715
Thanks anyway. But please,
I can't accept.

406
00:52:28,720 --> 00:52:30,358
What a nice pear!

407
00:52:52,840 --> 00:52:55,308
I'm Clemenza, you still
have my goods?

408
00:52:58,320 --> 00:53:00,231
Did you look inside?

409
00:53:01,960 --> 00:53:04,428
I'm not interested in things
that don't concern me.

410
00:53:15,400 --> 00:53:19,439
A friend of mine has a nice rug.
Maybe your wife would like it.

411
00:53:26,280 --> 00:53:29,556
Sure she would. But who has
money for a rug?

412
00:53:30,360 --> 00:53:34,876
It would be a present.
I know how to return a favour.

413
00:53:42,880 --> 00:53:44,632
Yeah, sure.

414
00:53:44,760 --> 00:53:46,637
My wife would like it.

415
00:54:10,080 --> 00:54:12,435
That son of a bitch! He isn't home!

416
00:54:16,040 --> 00:54:18,076
Damn, he didn't even leave the key.

417
00:54:22,680 --> 00:54:24,591
Well, he won't mind.

418
00:54:35,480 --> 00:54:36,754
Come on in.

419
00:54:37,800 --> 00:54:40,758
Hey, Vito, come on in!

420
00:55:01,960 --> 00:55:03,757
This is your friend's place?

421
00:55:06,400 --> 00:55:08,231
This is a real palace.

422
00:55:08,720 --> 00:55:10,312
One of the best.

423
00:55:16,680 --> 00:55:18,636
Vito, give me a hand, will you?

424
00:57:10,440 --> 00:57:13,193
Look how pretty it is, Santino!

425
00:59:35,920 --> 00:59:37,273
Come on in.

426
00:59:39,520 --> 00:59:42,239
It's all right. Hyman's in there.

427
00:59:42,360 --> 00:59:46,956
- Would you like a tuna sandwich?
- No, thank you.

428
00:59:53,280 --> 00:59:56,590
<i>... pick up of two by Holden.
Second and eight for S. C...</i>

429
00:59:57,760 --> 01:00:01,230
- Mr Roth?
- Come in, Michael.

430
01:00:03,160 --> 01:00:05,594
Sit down, make yourself comfortable.

431
01:00:07,400 --> 01:00:09,356
It's almost over.

432
01:00:11,120 --> 01:00:15,671
- Do you follow the football game?
- Not for a while I haven't.

433
01:00:16,240 --> 01:00:19,198
I enjoy watching football
in the afternoon.

434
01:00:19,320 --> 01:00:24,155
One of the things I love
about this country. Baseball too.

435
01:00:26,200 --> 01:00:31,194
Ever since Arnold Rothstein
fixed the World Series in 1919.

436
01:00:35,680 --> 01:00:37,875
I heard you had some trouble.

437
01:00:40,560 --> 01:00:42,232
Stupid.

438
01:00:43,320 --> 01:00:46,153
People behaving like that with guns.

439
01:00:48,200 --> 01:00:50,839
The important thing is you're all right.

440
01:00:50,960 --> 01:00:53,918
Good health is the most important thing.

441
01:00:54,840 --> 01:00:57,638
More than success, more than money.

442
01:00:59,160 --> 01:01:00,718
More than power.

443
01:01:14,480 --> 01:01:18,109
I came here because
there's going to be more bloodshed.

444
01:01:18,320 --> 01:01:22,108
I wanted you to know,
so another war won't start.

445
01:01:23,320 --> 01:01:26,153
Nobody wants another war.

446
01:01:26,280 --> 01:01:31,798
Frank Pentangeli asked my permission
to get rid of the Rosato brothers.

447
01:01:31,920 --> 01:01:35,549
When I refused he tried to have me
killed. He was stupid, I was lucky.

448
01:01:35,680 --> 01:01:37,591
I'll visit him soon.

449
01:01:37,720 --> 01:01:42,271
The important thing is that nothing
interferes with our plans for the future.

450
01:01:43,320 --> 01:01:45,675
Nothing is more important.

451
01:01:47,480 --> 01:01:52,349
- You're a wise and considerate man.
- And you're a great man, Mr Roth.

452
01:01:53,280 --> 01:01:58,035
- There's much I can learn from you.
- Whatever I can do to help, Michael.

453
01:02:00,200 --> 01:02:02,794
- Excuse me. Lunch.
- Come in.

454
01:02:02,920 --> 01:02:07,516
- Thank you, my dear.
- You're going to break your eardrums.

455
01:02:08,560 --> 01:02:10,869
- Enjoy it.
- Thank you.

456
01:02:16,280 --> 01:02:18,874
You're young, I'm old and sick.

457
01:02:19,960 --> 01:02:23,748
What we'll do in the next few months
will make history.

458
01:02:25,880 --> 01:02:27,757
It's never been done before.

459
01:02:27,880 --> 01:02:32,317
Not even your father would dream
that such a thing could be possible.

460
01:02:34,240 --> 01:02:38,631
Frank Pentangeli is a dead man.
You don't object?

461
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:42,833
He's small potatoes.

462
01:02:52,160 --> 01:02:54,469
What's up?

463
01:02:56,800 --> 01:02:59,030
We got company?

464
01:03:12,360 --> 01:03:13,554
What's going on?

465
01:03:13,720 --> 01:03:15,631
Michael Corleone is here.

466
01:03:17,960 --> 01:03:18,915
Where is he?

467
01:03:19,040 --> 01:03:20,758
He's in your den. You better hurry.

468
01:03:21,520 --> 01:03:23,351
He's been waiting a half hour.

469
01:03:30,320 --> 01:03:32,356
Is something wrong?

470
01:03:38,000 --> 01:03:39,956
I wish you would have let me know
you were coming.

471
01:03:40,080 --> 01:03:43,789
- I could have prepared something.
- I didn't want you to know.

472
01:03:51,480 --> 01:03:55,189
- You heard what happened?
- I almost died. We were so relieved...

473
01:03:55,320 --> 01:03:57,276
In my home!

474
01:04:00,080 --> 01:04:02,992
In my bedroom where my wife sleeps!

475
01:04:05,640 --> 01:04:07,835
Where my children come to play.

476
01:04:09,280 --> 01:04:11,236
In my home.

477
01:04:27,760 --> 01:04:30,593
I want you to help me take my revenge.

478
01:04:30,720 --> 01:04:34,156
Michael, anything. What can I do?

479
01:04:37,160 --> 01:04:40,232
Settle these troubles
with the Rosato brothers.

480
01:04:40,360 --> 01:04:42,874
I don't understand. I don't...

481
01:04:43,000 --> 01:04:47,710
I don't have your brain for big deals.
But this is a street thing.

482
01:04:47,840 --> 01:04:52,356
That Hyman Roth in Miami.
He's backing up those sons-of-bitches.

483
01:04:52,480 --> 01:04:57,031
- I know he is.
- So why ask me to lay down to them?

484
01:05:02,960 --> 01:05:05,872
It was Hyman Roth
that tried to have me killed.

485
01:05:07,600 --> 01:05:09,989
I know it was him.

486
01:05:11,000 --> 01:05:13,036
Jesus Christ, Mike.

487
01:05:13,160 --> 01:05:17,711
Jesus Christ, let's get them all.
Now while we've got the muscle.

488
01:05:22,600 --> 01:05:25,319
This used to be my father's old study.

489
01:05:26,480 --> 01:05:28,630
It's changed.

490
01:05:29,640 --> 01:05:33,599
I remember there used to be
a big desk here.

491
01:05:36,680 --> 01:05:41,629
I remember when I was a kid. We had
to be quiet when we played near here.

492
01:05:49,200 --> 01:05:52,476
I was very happy that this house
never went to strangers.

493
01:05:54,080 --> 01:05:57,595
First Clemenza took it over. Now you.

494
01:05:59,480 --> 01:06:03,712
My father taught me many things here.
He taught me in this room.

495
01:06:07,640 --> 01:06:13,476
He taught me, "Keep your friends close,
but your enemies closer."

496
01:06:13,600 --> 01:06:19,436
If Hyman Roth sees that I interceded
in this, in the Rosato brothers' favour,

497
01:06:19,560 --> 01:06:22,836
he'll think his relationship with me
is still good.

498
01:06:25,680 --> 01:06:27,875
That's what I want him to think.

499
01:06:28,800 --> 01:06:32,509
I want him relaxed and confident
in our friendship.

500
01:06:33,160 --> 01:06:36,994
Then I'll be able to find out
who the traitor in my family was.

501
01:07:03,400 --> 01:07:06,676
<i>- Yeah?
- Fredo, this is Johnny Ola.</i>

502
01:07:07,440 --> 01:07:11,069
<i>- We need some more help.
- Johnny?</i>

503
01:07:12,160 --> 01:07:14,879
Jesus Christ, what the hell time is it?

504
01:07:15,000 --> 01:07:17,639
<i>- Who's that, honey?
- Listen good, Fredo.</i>

505
01:07:17,840 --> 01:07:20,832
Why are you calling me?
I don't want to talk to you.

506
01:07:21,040 --> 01:07:24,237
<i>Pentangeli is going to accept
the Rosato brothers' deal.</i>

507
01:07:24,440 --> 01:07:26,431
<i>- Oh, God.
- Will he come alone?</i>

508
01:07:26,640 --> 01:07:29,598
I don't know. You've got me in
deep enough already.

509
01:07:29,800 --> 01:07:34,749
<i>Everything will be all right. Pentangeli
says he's willing to make a deal.</i>

510
01:07:34,960 --> 01:07:39,112
<i>All we want to know is if he's on
the level, or if he'll bring his boys.</i>

511
01:07:39,320 --> 01:07:42,278
You lied to me. I don't want you
to call me any more.

512
01:07:42,480 --> 01:07:47,156
<i>- Your brother won't find out we talked.
- I don't know what you're talking about.</i>

513
01:07:57,280 --> 01:08:00,955
- Who was that?
- Wrong number.

514
01:08:07,920 --> 01:08:11,879
- Frankie, I've got nobody here.
- Wait in the car, Cicc'.

515
01:08:12,000 --> 01:08:14,594
- Frankie.
- That's okay, Cicc'.

516
01:08:21,360 --> 01:08:25,399
- What's this?
- A lucky C note for our new deal.

517
01:08:28,000 --> 01:08:30,673
Ritchie. Give us a taste.

518
01:08:35,320 --> 01:08:38,551
We were all real happy
about your decision, Frankie.

519
01:08:38,680 --> 01:08:42,753
- You won't regret it.
- I don't like the C note, Rosato.

520
01:08:42,880 --> 01:08:45,348
I take that as an insult.

521
01:08:45,480 --> 01:08:48,358
Michael Corleone says hello!

522
01:09:04,880 --> 01:09:07,075
Close the door!

523
01:09:07,200 --> 01:09:09,111
Your friend the cop...

524
01:09:09,240 --> 01:09:13,597
Hey, Ritch. It's dark in here.
Are you open or closed?

525
01:09:13,720 --> 01:09:17,315
I just came in to clean up a little,
you know?

526
01:09:19,640 --> 01:09:21,596
What's the matter?

527
01:09:21,720 --> 01:09:24,632
- Is that something on the floor?
- Carmine, not here!

528
01:09:24,760 --> 01:09:26,159
Anthony!

529
01:09:29,280 --> 01:09:32,795
You open this bar
and I'll blow your head in!

530
01:10:16,680 --> 01:10:18,989
Freddy, it's good to see you.

531
01:10:21,320 --> 01:10:25,916
- How is he?
- He's okay. He's in the back.

532
01:10:29,520 --> 01:10:31,829
Girls, take a hike.

533
01:10:34,680 --> 01:10:36,796
In this room here.

534
01:10:39,440 --> 01:10:42,910
- I want to talk to him alone first.
- Come on.

535
01:10:51,320 --> 01:10:53,914
I thought I could help you, Senator.

536
01:10:57,640 --> 01:10:59,358
Hagen?

537
01:11:00,520 --> 01:11:04,479
- Listen, I did not...
- It's all right.

538
01:11:04,680 --> 01:11:09,196
- I didn't do anything.
- It's okay. You're very lucky.

539
01:11:10,000 --> 01:11:14,437
My brother Fredo operates this place.
He was called before anyone.

540
01:11:15,720 --> 01:11:19,349
Had this happened some place else,
we couldn't have helped you.

541
01:11:22,160 --> 01:11:25,391
When I woke up, I was on the floor.

542
01:11:26,280 --> 01:11:30,512
- And I don't know how it happened.
- You can't remember?

543
01:11:33,640 --> 01:11:35,676
I passed out.

544
01:11:51,160 --> 01:11:54,118
Just a game. Jesus.

545
01:12:04,400 --> 01:12:06,630
Jesus, Jesus!

546
01:12:11,000 --> 01:12:13,070
Jesus God!

547
01:12:13,200 --> 01:12:14,679
God!

548
01:12:17,600 --> 01:12:21,036
I don't know, and I don't understand
why I can't remember.

549
01:12:21,160 --> 01:12:24,197
Doesn't matter, just do as I say.

550
01:12:24,320 --> 01:12:29,599
Put in a call to your office.
Explain that you'll be there tomorrow.

551
01:12:30,600 --> 01:12:35,151
You decided to spend the night at
Michael Corleone's house in Tahoe.

552
01:12:35,280 --> 01:12:39,592
- As his guest.
- I do remember that she was laughing.

553
01:12:41,800 --> 01:12:47,033
We'd done it before, and I know
that I could not have hurt that girl.

554
01:12:47,880 --> 01:12:51,759
This girl has no family.
Nobody knows that she worked here.

555
01:12:51,880 --> 01:12:54,713
It'll be as though she never existed.

556
01:12:57,000 --> 01:12:59,833
All that's left is our friendship.

557
01:13:14,280 --> 01:13:17,317
- Yes?
- Sorry, but we're not to let you through.

558
01:13:18,600 --> 01:13:22,479
- I’m just going to the market.
- We'll pick up anything you want.

559
01:13:22,600 --> 01:13:25,558
- Whose orders are these?
- Mr Hagen's. He's coming.

560
01:13:25,680 --> 01:13:27,989
I'll speak to him.

561
01:13:33,600 --> 01:13:36,956
I wanted to explain,
but I had business in Carson City.

562
01:13:37,160 --> 01:13:41,358
It's Michael's request for your safety.
We'll get anything you need.

563
01:13:41,480 --> 01:13:46,474
- So I'm supposed to stay in my house?
- No, within the compound will be fine.

564
01:13:46,600 --> 01:13:49,592
- We were going to New England.
- That's off.

565
01:13:50,360 --> 01:13:53,193
- Am I a prisoner?
- That's not how we see it, Kay.

566
01:13:54,160 --> 01:13:57,232
Come on, kids.
We're going back to the house.

567
01:13:58,720 --> 01:14:00,472
Joe.

568
01:14:44,360 --> 01:14:46,078
Cuba, Cuba!

569
01:15:25,480 --> 01:15:28,358
Most respected gentlemen.

570
01:15:28,480 --> 01:15:30,516
Welcome to Havana.

571
01:15:32,640 --> 01:15:37,555
I want to thank this distinguished group
of American industrialists

572
01:15:39,280 --> 01:15:42,033
for continuing to work with Cuba

573
01:15:42,800 --> 01:15:45,758
for the greatest period of prosperity

574
01:15:46,680 --> 01:15:49,274
in her entire history.

575
01:15:49,720 --> 01:15:51,631
Mr William Shaw,

576
01:15:51,760 --> 01:15:54,399
representing
the General Fruit Company.

577
01:15:55,320 --> 01:15:57,276
Messrs. Corngold and Dant,

578
01:15:58,160 --> 01:16:00,958
of United Telephone
and Telegraph Company.

579
01:16:02,280 --> 01:16:03,679
Mr Petty,

580
01:16:03,800 --> 01:16:07,509
Regional Vice President of
the Pan American Mining Corporation.

581
01:16:09,360 --> 01:16:12,079
Mr Robert Allen
of South American Sugar.

582
01:16:13,920 --> 01:16:16,115
Mr Michael Corleone of Nevada,

583
01:16:17,720 --> 01:16:22,032
representing our associates
in tourism and leisure activities.

584
01:16:22,160 --> 01:16:25,550
And my old friend and associate
from Florida,

585
01:16:27,160 --> 01:16:28,878
Mr Hyman Roth.

586
01:16:29,160 --> 01:16:34,109
I would like to thank United Telephone
and Telegraph for their Christmas gift.

587
01:16:39,240 --> 01:16:41,356
A solid gold telephone.

588
01:16:43,680 --> 01:16:46,990
Perhaps you gentlemen
would like to look at it.

589
01:16:47,800 --> 01:16:49,518
- Mr President?
- Yes?

590
01:16:49,640 --> 01:16:54,998
Could you discuss the rebel activity and
what this can mean to our businesses?

591
01:16:55,480 --> 01:16:56,629
- Of course.
- Heavy stuff.

592
01:16:56,760 --> 01:17:02,153
I assure you that, although the rebels
have started a campaign in Las Villas,

593
01:17:08,640 --> 01:17:14,112
my staff indicates, with assurance,
that we'll drive them out of Santa Clara

594
01:17:14,240 --> 01:17:16,151
before the New Year.

595
01:17:17,920 --> 01:17:19,797
I want to put you all at ease.

596
01:17:20,680 --> 01:17:24,639
We will tolerate no guerrillas
in the casinos or the swimming pools.

597
01:17:42,160 --> 01:17:44,310
He said that they're making an arrest,

598
01:17:44,440 --> 01:17:47,034
and in a few minutes
he'll let us through.

599
01:17:47,160 --> 01:17:48,149
Johnny...

600
01:17:48,280 --> 01:17:49,235
It's nothing.

601
01:17:50,000 --> 01:17:52,560
Just some lousy bandits.
The police are cleaning them up.

602
01:17:55,560 --> 01:17:56,879
<i>Viva Fidel!</i>

603
01:18:12,040 --> 01:18:16,750
I hope my age is correct.
I'm always accurate about my age.

604
01:18:17,920 --> 01:18:21,549
Make sure that everybody
sees the cake before we cut it.

605
01:18:24,520 --> 01:18:26,954
I'm very pleased

606
01:18:27,080 --> 01:18:31,471
you're all able to come from
such distances to be with me today.

607
01:18:33,000 --> 01:18:35,673
When a man comes
to this point in his life,

608
01:18:37,120 --> 01:18:40,317
he wants to turn over
the things he's been blessed with.

609
01:18:40,440 --> 01:18:45,275
Turn them over to friends,
as a reward for the friends he's had

610
01:18:46,560 --> 01:18:51,554
and to make sure that everything
goes well after he's gone.

611
01:18:51,680 --> 01:18:54,240
- Not for years.
- Hear, hear!

612
01:18:54,360 --> 01:18:58,273
We'll see. The doctors would disagree,
but what do they know?

613
01:18:59,600 --> 01:19:04,310
These are wonderful things
that we've achieved in Havana

614
01:19:04,440 --> 01:19:07,318
and there's no limit
to where we can go from here.

615
01:19:07,440 --> 01:19:11,991
This kind of government knows
how to help business, to encourage it.

616
01:19:12,120 --> 01:19:15,954
The hotels here are bigger
and swankier

617
01:19:16,080 --> 01:19:18,310
than any of the joints in Vegas.

618
01:19:18,920 --> 01:19:21,753
We can thank our friends
in the Cuban government

619
01:19:21,880 --> 01:19:26,396
which has put up half the cash with the
Teamsters, on a dollar for dollar basis

620
01:19:26,520 --> 01:19:29,193
and has relaxed restrictions on imports.

621
01:19:29,320 --> 01:19:33,518
What I'm saying is that we have now
what we have always needed...

622
01:19:33,640 --> 01:19:36,313
Real partnership with a government.

623
01:19:36,440 --> 01:19:38,237
Smaller piece.

624
01:19:39,080 --> 01:19:43,710
You all know Michael Corleone
and we all remember his father.

625
01:19:43,840 --> 01:19:47,355
At the time of my retirement, or death,

626
01:19:47,480 --> 01:19:53,112
I turn over all my interests
in the Havana operation to his control.

627
01:19:53,240 --> 01:19:56,869
But, all of you will share.

628
01:19:57,000 --> 01:20:00,675
The Nacionale will go
to the Lakeville Road Boys,

629
01:20:00,800 --> 01:20:03,951
the Capri to the Corleone family,

630
01:20:04,080 --> 01:20:06,355
the Sevilla Biltmore also,

631
01:20:06,480 --> 01:20:09,916
but Eddie Levine will bring in the
Pennino brothers,

632
01:20:10,040 --> 01:20:12,156
Dino and Eddie, for a piece

633
01:20:12,280 --> 01:20:14,874
and to handle the casino operations.

634
01:20:15,000 --> 01:20:18,276
We've saved a piece
for some friends in Nevada

635
01:20:18,400 --> 01:20:21,915
to make sure that things go smoothly
back home.

636
01:20:24,080 --> 01:20:28,756
I want all of you to enjoy your cake.
So, enjoy!

637
01:20:28,880 --> 01:20:31,189
<i>- Happy birthday!
- L'chaim!</i>

638
01:20:32,400 --> 01:20:34,994
I saw an interesting thing happen today.

639
01:20:36,280 --> 01:20:39,317
A rebel was being arrested
by the military police.

640
01:20:39,440 --> 01:20:43,638
Rather than be taken alive, he exploded
a grenade he had in his jacket.

641
01:20:43,760 --> 01:20:47,196
He killed himself and took a captain
of the command with him.

642
01:20:47,320 --> 01:20:50,915
- Those rebels are lunatics.
- Maybe so.

643
01:20:52,560 --> 01:20:57,270
But it occurred to me, that the soldiers
are paid to fight, the rebels aren't.

644
01:20:57,400 --> 01:21:00,949
- What does that tell you?
- They can win.

645
01:21:03,240 --> 01:21:06,789
This country has had rebels
for 50 years. It's in their blood.

646
01:21:06,920 --> 01:21:10,469
I know, I've been coming here
since the Twenties.

647
01:21:10,600 --> 01:21:14,195
We were running molasses
from Havana when you were a baby.

648
01:21:14,320 --> 01:21:16,754
The trucks were owned by your father.

649
01:21:17,840 --> 01:21:19,353
Michael.

650
01:21:26,200 --> 01:21:30,159
I'd rather we talked about this
when we're alone.

651
01:21:31,760 --> 01:21:34,672
The two million never got to the island.

652
01:21:40,120 --> 01:21:43,112
It mustn't be known
that you held back the money

653
01:21:43,240 --> 01:21:45,549
because you worried about the rebels.

654
01:21:52,120 --> 01:21:55,237
Sit down, Michael. Sit down.

655
01:22:02,560 --> 01:22:06,235
If I could only live to see it,
to be there with you.

656
01:22:08,680 --> 01:22:12,673
What I wouldn't give for 20 more years.

657
01:22:14,520 --> 01:22:18,559
Here we are, protected. Free to make
our profits without Kefauver,

658
01:22:18,680 --> 01:22:22,195
the goddamn Justice Department
and the FBI.

659
01:22:22,920 --> 01:22:26,276
90 miles away, in partnership
with a friendly government.

660
01:22:27,440 --> 01:22:30,716
90 miles. It's nothing.

661
01:22:31,640 --> 01:22:37,351
Just one small step for a man looking
to be President of the United States

662
01:22:37,480 --> 01:22:40,233
and having the cash
to make it possible.

663
01:22:40,640 --> 01:22:42,073
Michael,

664
01:22:43,920 --> 01:22:46,195
we're bigger than U.S. Steel.

665
01:23:11,880 --> 01:23:14,713
Mikey, how are you? Okay?

666
01:23:16,040 --> 01:23:20,477
<i>- Hi! Freddy Corleone.
- Mio frati.</i>

667
01:23:21,760 --> 01:23:23,637
Jesus Christ, what a trip!

668
01:23:24,160 --> 01:23:27,197
I thought, "What if somebody knows
what I've got in here".

669
01:23:27,680 --> 01:23:31,958
Can you imagine that? Two million
dollars on the seat next to me.

670
01:23:35,680 --> 01:23:37,716
- Excuse me.
- It's okay.

671
01:23:39,720 --> 01:23:41,392
You want to count it?

672
01:23:45,360 --> 01:23:49,148
What's going on? I'm totally in the dark.

673
01:23:49,280 --> 01:23:53,796
The family is making an investment in
Havana. This is a gift for the President.

674
01:23:54,720 --> 01:23:58,110
That's great! Havana's great.

675
01:23:59,640 --> 01:24:01,631
It's my kind of town.

676
01:24:02,880 --> 01:24:07,431
- Anybody I know in Havana?
- Don't know. Hyman Roth, Johnny Ola?

677
01:24:10,240 --> 01:24:12,754
No. I've never met them.

678
01:24:16,280 --> 01:24:20,114
Listen, Mikey, I'm kind of...

679
01:24:24,000 --> 01:24:28,198
Kind of nervous from the trip.
Can I get a drink or something?

680
01:24:28,840 --> 01:24:31,354
I thought maybe we'd go out together.

681
01:24:32,160 --> 01:24:35,436
I know a place where
we can spend some time together.

682
01:24:37,440 --> 01:24:41,797
Sometimes I think I should have
married a woman like you did. Like Kay.

683
01:24:42,840 --> 01:24:45,559
Have kids. Have a family.

684
01:24:47,680 --> 01:24:51,389
For once in my life, be more like

685
01:24:52,280 --> 01:24:53,838
Pop.

686
01:24:56,120 --> 01:25:00,432
It's not easy to be a son, Fredo.
It's not easy.

687
01:25:00,640 --> 01:25:03,632
Mama used to say,
"You don't belong to me."

688
01:25:03,760 --> 01:25:07,116
"You were left on the doorstep
by gypsies."

689
01:25:07,240 --> 01:25:09,231
Sometimes I think it's true.

690
01:25:10,120 --> 01:25:12,156
You're no gypsy, Fredo.

691
01:25:13,480 --> 01:25:17,109
Mikey, I was mad at you.

692
01:25:24,560 --> 01:25:27,950
Why didn't we spend time
like this before?

693
01:25:28,160 --> 01:25:30,549
You want a drink, right? Waiter!

694
01:25:34,600 --> 01:25:36,591
<i>Por favour...</i>

695
01:25:37,960 --> 01:25:40,679
- How do you say Banana Daiquiri?
- Banana Daiquiri.

696
01:25:40,880 --> 01:25:43,030
- That's it?
- That's it.

697
01:25:43,160 --> 01:25:45,116
<i>Uno Banana Daiquiri</i>

698
01:25:45,760 --> 01:25:48,274
and a club soda.

699
01:25:55,800 --> 01:25:58,394
Senator Geary flies in from Washington
tomorrow

700
01:25:58,520 --> 01:26:00,875
with some government people.

701
01:26:01,000 --> 01:26:04,470
I want you to show them
a good time in Havana.

702
01:26:06,320 --> 01:26:10,233
- That's my speciality, right?
- Can I trust you with something?

703
01:26:10,960 --> 01:26:13,269
Of course, Mike.

704
01:26:15,400 --> 01:26:19,029
Later in the evening we're all invited
to the Presidential Palace

705
01:26:19,160 --> 01:26:20,752
to bring in the New Year.

706
01:26:21,280 --> 01:26:26,718
After it's over they'll take me home
in a military car, alone.

707
01:26:26,840 --> 01:26:28,478
For my protection.

708
01:26:29,480 --> 01:26:32,870
Before I reach my hotel,
I'll be assassinated.

709
01:26:50,240 --> 01:26:52,959
- Who?
- Roth.

710
01:26:58,640 --> 01:27:01,359
It was Roth who tried to kill me
in my home.

711
01:27:03,200 --> 01:27:05,430
It was Roth all along.

712
01:27:05,560 --> 01:27:09,269
He acts like I'm his son, his successor.

713
01:27:10,360 --> 01:27:13,352
But he thinks he'll live forever
and wants me out.

714
01:27:18,080 --> 01:27:22,471
- How can I help?
- Just go along, as if you know nothing.

715
01:27:22,600 --> 01:27:25,160
- I've already made my move.
- What move?

716
01:27:26,440 --> 01:27:28,720
Hyman Roth won't see the New Year.

717
01:27:45,480 --> 01:27:49,234
You're to take it easy,
he'll be back tomorrow.

718
01:27:49,360 --> 01:27:51,555
Fly in my own doctor from Miami.

719
01:27:51,680 --> 01:27:54,035
I don't trust a doctor
who can't speak English.

720
01:27:55,520 --> 01:27:58,239
<i>- Gracias, señor.
- Buenas noches.</i>

721
01:28:00,040 --> 01:28:03,510
- Honey, go to the casino.
- If you're feeling better.

722
01:28:03,720 --> 01:28:05,278
Feel fine.

723
01:28:07,080 --> 01:28:11,039
- Play the bingo game.
- Okay. Nice to see you, Mr Paul.

724
01:28:13,480 --> 01:28:18,235
My sixth sense tells me Fredo brought
a bag full of money. Where is it?

725
01:28:20,640 --> 01:28:26,909
- You're pulling out?
- Just want to... Just want to wait.

726
01:28:30,440 --> 01:28:33,750
- How do you feel?
- Terrible.

727
01:28:33,960 --> 01:28:37,350
I'd give four million to be able to take
a painless piss.

728
01:28:37,960 --> 01:28:43,432
- Who had Frank Pentangeli killed?
- The Rosato brothers.

729
01:28:43,640 --> 01:28:46,632
I know, but who gave the go-ahead?

730
01:28:47,600 --> 01:28:49,079
I know I didn't.

731
01:28:56,760 --> 01:29:01,595
There was this kid I grew up with.
He was younger than me.

732
01:29:01,720 --> 01:29:07,955
Sort of looked up to me, you know.
We did our first work together.

733
01:29:08,080 --> 01:29:11,675
Worked our way out of the street.
Things were good.

734
01:29:12,920 --> 01:29:17,277
During Prohibition
we ran molasses into Canada.

735
01:29:17,440 --> 01:29:20,352
Made a fortune. Your father, too.

736
01:29:21,960 --> 01:29:27,717
As much as anyone,
I loved him and trusted him.

737
01:29:30,400 --> 01:29:36,032
Later on he had an idea to build a city

738
01:29:36,160 --> 01:29:39,755
out of a desert stop-over
for G.I. S going to the West Coast.

739
01:29:41,600 --> 01:29:45,115
That kid's name was Moe Greene

740
01:29:45,240 --> 01:29:48,710
and the city he invented was Las Vegas.

741
01:29:50,120 --> 01:29:52,475
This was a great man.

742
01:29:52,600 --> 01:29:54,875
A man of vision and guts.

743
01:29:55,000 --> 01:30:00,950
And there isn't even a plaque,
signpost or statue of him in that town.

744
01:30:02,920 --> 01:30:06,356
Someone put a bullet through his eye.

745
01:30:07,560 --> 01:30:09,755
No one knows who gave the order.

746
01:30:10,760 --> 01:30:13,911
When I heard it, I wasn't angry.

747
01:30:14,040 --> 01:30:19,637
I knew Moe, I knew he was headstrong.
Talking loud, saying stupid things.

748
01:30:19,760 --> 01:30:24,356
So when he turned up dead, I let it go.

749
01:30:26,080 --> 01:30:29,152
And I said to myself,

750
01:30:29,280 --> 01:30:33,034
"This is the business we've chosen."

751
01:30:33,160 --> 01:30:35,276
I didn't ask

752
01:30:35,840 --> 01:30:40,789
who gave the order, because it had
nothing to do with business.

753
01:30:49,000 --> 01:30:53,278
That two million in a bag in your room...

754
01:30:55,480 --> 01:30:58,950
I'm going in to take a nap.

755
01:30:59,600 --> 01:31:04,674
When I wake, if the money
is on the table, I know I have a partner.

756
01:31:05,280 --> 01:31:08,192
If it isn't, I know I don't.

757
01:32:01,000 --> 01:32:04,993
Does everybody know everybody?
You know Senator Geary.

758
01:32:05,200 --> 01:32:08,192
Good to see you, Mike.
I'm glad we spend this time together.

759
01:32:08,320 --> 01:32:11,073
Senator Payton from Florida...

760
01:32:11,440 --> 01:32:14,432
Judge DeMalco from New York...

761
01:32:14,640 --> 01:32:17,313
Senator Ream from Maryland...

762
01:32:17,480 --> 01:32:19,835
Fred Corngold from UTT.

763
01:32:19,960 --> 01:32:23,714
- That Fred does a mean cha-cha-cha!
- He does?

764
01:32:23,840 --> 01:32:25,990
Gentlemen, it's refill time!

765
01:32:26,120 --> 01:32:30,398
You might try some of the local drinks.
Cuba Libre, Piña Colada...

766
01:32:30,520 --> 01:32:34,195
I think I'll try
one of those redheaded Yolandas.

767
01:32:34,320 --> 01:32:36,993
<i>- That you got! Con gusto...
- Johnny!</i>

768
01:32:38,160 --> 01:32:41,550
You don't know my brother Fredo.
Johnny Ola, Fredo.

769
01:32:41,760 --> 01:32:45,150
- We never met. Johnny Ola.
- Pleasure.

770
01:32:46,400 --> 01:32:48,709
Gentlemen, to a night in Havana!

771
01:32:48,920 --> 01:32:50,433
- Happy New Year!
- Happy New Year!

772
01:32:50,640 --> 01:32:53,393
<i>- Feliz Año Nuevo!
- Happy New Year.</i>

773
01:33:04,640 --> 01:33:08,553
- Hey, Freddy, why are we standing?
- Everybody stands.

774
01:33:08,760 --> 01:33:13,151
- It's worth it. You won't believe this.
- I don't believe it already.

775
01:33:13,280 --> 01:33:16,192
- 50 dollars, right?
- You've got a bet, mister.

776
01:33:24,080 --> 01:33:25,479
That's Superman.

777
01:33:58,160 --> 01:34:00,276
Did I tell you or did I tell you?

778
01:34:01,960 --> 01:34:04,394
- I don't believe it!
- It's got to be fake.

779
01:34:04,600 --> 01:34:07,751
It's real. That's why
he's called Superman.

780
01:34:08,280 --> 01:34:12,114
Hey, Freddy, where did you find
this place?

781
01:34:12,240 --> 01:34:16,438
Johnny Ola brought me here. I didn't
believe it, but seeing is believing!

782
01:34:16,560 --> 01:34:19,836
- I see it, but still don't believe it!
- 50 bucks, Pat.

783
01:34:19,960 --> 01:34:23,350
Roth won't go here,
but Johnny knows these places!

784
01:34:24,280 --> 01:34:28,990
- Watch, he'll break a cracker with it.
- I want to see him break a brick!

785
01:35:47,640 --> 01:35:50,837
Relax, we're taking you to the hospital.

786
01:36:37,960 --> 01:36:40,269
...and you'll continue to get those.

787
01:36:40,480 --> 01:36:44,678
I don't believe that President
Eisenhower would ever pull out of Cuba

788
01:36:44,800 --> 01:36:48,270
as we have over one billion dollars
invested in this country.

789
01:36:51,680 --> 01:36:54,797
The American public
believe in non-intervention...

790
01:36:54,920 --> 01:36:57,673
Fredo! Where are you going?

791
01:36:57,800 --> 01:37:01,270
I'm getting a real drink,
because I can't...

792
01:37:54,600 --> 01:37:57,990
What kept Mr Roth?
I understood he was coming.

793
01:37:58,120 --> 01:38:01,430
Reeves, what's the protocol?
How long should we stay?

794
01:38:02,840 --> 01:38:07,516
I think a half hour ought to do it. Just
long enough to bring in the New Year.

795
01:38:22,360 --> 01:38:25,511
It's New Year's Eve. Come on,
just for a minute.

796
01:39:37,440 --> 01:39:41,399
There's a plane waiting to take us
to Miami in an hour.

797
01:39:41,600 --> 01:39:44,068
Don't make a big thing about it.

798
01:39:47,360 --> 01:39:50,989
I know it was you, Fredo.
You broke my heart.

799
01:39:52,480 --> 01:39:54,152
You broke my heart!

800
01:40:32,760 --> 01:40:37,072
Due to serious setbacks to our
troops in Guantanamo and Santiago...

801
01:40:38,000 --> 01:40:40,195
...my position in Cuba is untenable.

802
01:40:42,520 --> 01:40:46,479
I am resigning from office
to avoid further bloodshed.

803
01:40:47,240 --> 01:40:50,232
And I shall leave the city immediately.

804
01:40:54,320 --> 01:40:57,153
I wish all of you good luck.

805
01:41:04,280 --> 01:41:07,158
<i>Salud!</i>

806
01:41:08,360 --> 01:41:11,591
<i>Viva la revolución! Viva Fidel!</i>

807
01:41:32,560 --> 01:41:33,993
Fredo!

808
01:41:34,680 --> 01:41:38,434
Come on. Come with me.
It's the only way out of here tonight.

809
01:41:39,040 --> 01:41:40,871
Roth is dead.

810
01:41:41,680 --> 01:41:45,673
Fredo, come with me!
You're still my brother.

811
01:41:46,800 --> 01:41:48,199
Fredo!

812
01:42:11,840 --> 01:42:14,513
I'm Pat Geary, United States Senator.

813
01:42:43,000 --> 01:42:46,151
Fidel! Fidel! Fidel!

814
01:43:24,880 --> 01:43:28,236
Al. Get me a wet towel.

815
01:43:34,480 --> 01:43:37,199
Does Kay know I'm back?

816
01:43:41,160 --> 01:43:44,072
My boy? Did you get him
something for Christmas?

817
01:43:44,200 --> 01:43:47,431
- I took care of it.
- What was it, so I'll know.

818
01:43:47,640 --> 01:43:52,430
It was a little car with an electric motor
that he can ride in. It's nice.

819
01:43:54,920 --> 01:43:56,876
Thank you, Al.

820
01:43:58,000 --> 01:44:01,310
Fellows, could you step outside
for a minute?

821
01:44:17,720 --> 01:44:19,358
Where's my brother?

822
01:44:20,280 --> 01:44:23,317
Roth got out on a private boat.
He's in a hospital in Miami.

823
01:44:23,440 --> 01:44:27,956
He had a stroke, but recovered okay.
Your bodyguard is dead.

824
01:44:28,080 --> 01:44:29,798
I asked about Fredo.

825
01:44:30,800 --> 01:44:34,031
I think he got out.
He must be somewhere in New York.

826
01:44:36,960 --> 01:44:38,234
All right.

827
01:44:39,480 --> 01:44:42,153
I want you to get in touch with him.

828
01:44:42,280 --> 01:44:44,953
I know he's scared.
Tell him everything is all right.

829
01:44:45,080 --> 01:44:50,154
Tell him I know Roth misled him. That
he didn't know they would try to kill me.

830
01:44:51,080 --> 01:44:55,153
- They can come in now.
- There was something else.

831
01:44:56,160 --> 01:44:57,559
What?

832
01:45:04,280 --> 01:45:05,952
What? Come on.

833
01:45:07,880 --> 01:45:10,075
Kay had a miscarriage.

834
01:45:22,520 --> 01:45:24,795
- Was it a boy?
- At three and a half months...

835
01:45:24,920 --> 01:45:28,913
Can't you give me a straight answer?
Was it a boy?

836
01:45:31,640 --> 01:45:34,074
I really don't know.

837
01:45:48,720 --> 01:45:51,553
Poor little Fredo, he's got pneumonia.

838
01:46:35,120 --> 01:46:38,669
Young man, I hear you and
your friends are stealing goods.

839
01:46:39,040 --> 01:46:42,589
But you don't even send a
dress to my house. No respect!

840
01:46:43,240 --> 01:46:45,117
You know I've got three daughters.

841
01:46:45,640 --> 01:46:47,198
This is my neighbourhood.

842
01:46:48,040 --> 01:46:51,237
You and your friends should
show me some respect.

843
01:46:52,360 --> 01:46:55,909
You should let me wet
my beak a little.

844
01:46:58,200 --> 01:47:01,636
I hear you and your friends
cleared $600 each.

845
01:47:02,360 --> 01:47:06,592
Give me $200 each, for your own
protection. And I'll forget the insult.

846
01:47:07,040 --> 01:47:11,830
You young punks have to learn
to respect a man like me!

847
01:47:14,120 --> 01:47:16,395
Otherwise the cops will
come to your house.

848
01:47:16,840 --> 01:47:19,229
And your family will be ruined.

849
01:47:20,440 --> 01:47:25,468
Of course if I'm wrong about how much
you stole - I'll take a little less.

850
01:47:26,160 --> 01:47:29,948
And by less, I only mean -
a hundred bucks less.

851
01:47:30,360 --> 01:47:32,078
Now don't refuse me.

852
01:47:33,960 --> 01:47:35,598
Understand, paisan?

853
01:47:41,880 --> 01:47:43,199
I understand.

854
01:47:45,600 --> 01:47:49,991
My friends and I share all the money.
So first, I have to talk to them.

855
01:47:51,360 --> 01:47:55,478
Tell your friends I don't want a lot.
Just enough to wet my beak.

856
01:47:59,600 --> 01:48:01,716
Don't be afraid to tell them!

857
01:48:04,080 --> 01:48:05,718
600 bucks...

858
01:48:06,040 --> 01:48:08,190
Suppose we don't pay?

859
01:48:09,360 --> 01:48:12,591
You know his gang, Tessio.
Real animals.

860
01:48:13,400 --> 01:48:16,597
Maranzalla himself let Fanucci
work this neighbourhood.

861
01:48:17,520 --> 01:48:20,830
<i>He's got connections with the cops, too.
We have to pay him.</i>

862
01:48:21,560 --> 01:48:23,357
$200 each... everybody agreed?

863
01:48:27,760 --> 01:48:29,159
Why do we have to pay him?

864
01:48:29,760 --> 01:48:31,910
Vito, leave this to us.

865
01:48:33,520 --> 01:48:35,829
He's one person, we're three.

866
01:48:36,160 --> 01:48:38,674
He's got guns, we've got guns.

867
01:48:39,240 --> 01:48:42,391
Why should we give him the
money we sweated for?

868
01:48:42,680 --> 01:48:44,750
<i>This is his neighbourhood!</i>

869
01:48:46,440 --> 01:48:50,752
I know two bookies who don't give
anything to Fanucci.

870
01:48:51,280 --> 01:48:52,713
Who?

871
01:48:53,080 --> 01:48:56,868
Joe The Greek and Frank Pignattaro.

872
01:48:57,000 --> 01:48:58,399
They don't pay Fanucci.

873
01:49:00,160 --> 01:49:04,836
<i>If they don't pay Fanucci, then
somebody else collects for Maranzalla!</i>

874
01:49:06,000 --> 01:49:09,788
We'll all be better off if we
pay him. Don't worry.

875
01:49:24,760 --> 01:49:27,399
Now what I say stays in this room.

876
01:49:27,680 --> 01:49:32,276
If you both like, why not give me
$50 each to pay Fanucci?

877
01:49:35,360 --> 01:49:38,477
I guarantee he'll accept
what I give him.

878
01:49:41,040 --> 01:49:43,235
If Fanucci says $200...

879
01:49:43,360 --> 01:49:44,679
<i>...he means it, Vito!</i>

880
01:49:45,160 --> 01:49:47,958
I'll reason with him.

881
01:49:50,040 --> 01:49:51,917
Leave everything to me.

882
01:49:52,600 --> 01:49:54,511
I'll take care of everything.

883
01:49:56,160 --> 01:49:58,594
I never lie to my friends.

884
01:49:59,440 --> 01:50:02,159
Tomorrow you both go talk to Fanucci.

885
01:50:02,520 --> 01:50:04,238
He'll ask for the money.

886
01:50:06,520 --> 01:50:10,877
Tell him you'll pay whatever
he wants. Don't argue with him.

887
01:50:11,400 --> 01:50:13,960
Then I'll go and get him to agree.

888
01:50:16,120 --> 01:50:18,714
Don't argue with him, since
he's so tough.

889
01:50:19,520 --> 01:50:21,954
How can you get him to take less?

890
01:50:22,400 --> 01:50:24,391
That's my business.

891
01:50:25,080 --> 01:50:28,231
Just remember that I did you a favour.

892
01:50:31,960 --> 01:50:33,393
Is it a deal?

893
01:50:35,080 --> 01:50:36,035
Yes.

894
01:51:22,000 --> 01:51:24,230
His family's out of the house.

895
01:51:24,600 --> 01:51:26,795
Fanucci's alone in the cafe.

896
01:51:31,520 --> 01:51:35,035
<i>Vito, here's my 50 dollars.
Buona fortuna.</i>

897
01:51:45,680 --> 01:51:48,069
Are you sure he's going to go for it?

898
01:51:51,440 --> 01:51:55,558
I'll make an offer he don't refuse.
Don't worry.

899
01:52:27,280 --> 01:52:31,717
It looks like there's -
$ 100 under my hat.

900
01:52:43,120 --> 01:52:45,190
I was right.

901
01:52:46,640 --> 01:52:48,278
Only $ 100...

902
01:52:51,560 --> 01:52:53,676
I'm short of money right now.

903
01:52:55,520 --> 01:52:59,877
I've been out of work... so just
give me a little time.

904
01:53:00,760 --> 01:53:02,830
You understand, don't you?

905
01:53:10,760 --> 01:53:13,228
You've got balls, young man!

906
01:53:15,200 --> 01:53:18,078
How come I never heard
of you before?

907
01:53:24,400 --> 01:53:26,630
You've got a lot of guts.

908
01:53:30,480 --> 01:53:33,278
I'll find you some work
for good money.

909
01:53:44,240 --> 01:53:48,279
No hard feelings, right? If I can
help you, let me know.

910
01:53:51,000 --> 01:53:53,275
You've done well for yourself.

911
01:53:57,080 --> 01:53:59,071
Enjoy the festa!

912
01:56:03,080 --> 01:56:05,275
Oh, this is too violent for me!

913
01:58:21,600 --> 01:58:22,953
What've you got there?

914
02:00:55,160 --> 02:00:58,869
Michael, your father loves you
very much.

915
02:04:15,640 --> 02:04:19,076
<i>Mr Cicci, from the year 1942
to the present time,</i>

916
02:04:19,200 --> 02:04:22,510
<i>you were an employee
of the Genco Olive Oil Company?</i>

917
02:04:22,960 --> 02:04:24,473
<i>That's right.</i>

918
02:04:25,400 --> 02:04:29,393
<i>But in actuality you were a member
of the Corleone crime organisation.</i>

919
02:04:32,240 --> 02:04:35,915
<i>No, we called it
the Corleone family, Senator.</i>

920
02:04:36,320 --> 02:04:38,675
<i>What was your position?</i>

921
02:04:39,560 --> 02:04:42,677
<i>At first, like everybody else,
I was a soldier.</i>

922
02:04:42,800 --> 02:04:45,553
<i>- What is that?
- A button, you know, Senator.</i>

923
02:04:45,680 --> 02:04:47,955
<i>No, I don't know. Tell me.</i>

924
02:04:49,440 --> 02:04:54,798
<i>When the boss says "push a button" on
a guy, I push a button. See, Senator?</i>

925
02:04:54,920 --> 02:04:56,148
<i>Mr Questadt.</i>

926
02:04:56,760 --> 02:04:58,796
<i>- You mean you kill people?
- What?</i>

927
02:04:58,920 --> 02:05:03,789
<i>You kill people at
the behest of your superiors.</i>

928
02:05:07,440 --> 02:05:08,873
<i>Yeah, that's right.</i>

929
02:05:09,000 --> 02:05:14,028
<i>And the head of your family
is Michael Corleone?</i>

930
02:05:14,160 --> 02:05:17,152
<i>Yeah, Counsellor. Michael Corleone.</i>

931
02:05:17,280 --> 02:05:20,909
<i>Did you ever get such an order
directly from Michael Corleone?</i>

932
02:05:21,720 --> 02:05:23,631
<i>No, I never talked to him.</i>

933
02:05:23,760 --> 02:05:27,514
<i>Mr Cicci, could you amplify
your answer a bit?</i>

934
02:05:27,640 --> 02:05:30,791
<i>- Do what?
- Could you expand on your answer?</i>

935
02:05:30,920 --> 02:05:36,472
<i>I'm particularly interested in knowing,
was there always a buffer involved?</i>

936
02:05:36,600 --> 02:05:40,912
<i>Someone in between you
and your superiors who gave the order.</i>

937
02:05:41,040 --> 02:05:45,238
<i>Right, a buffer.
The family had a lot of buffers!</i>

938
02:05:47,080 --> 02:05:51,039
<i>You may find this very amusing, but
the members of this committee do not.</i>

939
02:06:18,160 --> 02:06:20,230
Tell me something, Ma.

940
02:06:24,200 --> 02:06:27,670
What did Papa think...
deep in his heart?

941
02:06:34,080 --> 02:06:35,798
He was being strong...

942
02:06:42,080 --> 02:06:43,559
Strong for his family.

943
02:06:53,000 --> 02:06:55,514
But by being strong for his family...

944
02:06:57,000 --> 02:06:58,718
...could he...

945
02:07:00,640 --> 02:07:01,834
...lose it?

946
02:07:03,720 --> 02:07:08,840
You're thinking about your wife...
about the baby you lost.

947
02:07:10,680 --> 02:07:13,752
But you and your wife can
always have another baby.

948
02:07:15,440 --> 02:07:18,955
<i>No, I meant... lose his family.</i>

949
02:07:21,360 --> 02:07:24,670
But you can never lose your family.

950
02:07:33,840 --> 02:07:35,558
Times are changing.

951
02:07:57,240 --> 02:07:59,549
It's my pleasure.
I don't want money.

952
02:08:00,360 --> 02:08:01,952
Take it as a gift.

953
02:08:04,800 --> 02:08:08,759
If there's something I can do for you,
you come, we talk.

954
02:08:24,800 --> 02:08:27,473
Signora Colombo, why did you
come to see me?

955
02:08:30,360 --> 02:08:33,716
Your wife told me to ask
if you could help me.

956
02:08:36,280 --> 02:08:38,157
She's in bad trouble.

957
02:08:38,880 --> 02:08:42,668
Her neighbours complained to the
landlord about her dog.

958
02:08:44,080 --> 02:08:46,196
He told her to get rid of the animal.

959
02:08:47,800 --> 02:08:51,759
But her little boy loves that dog.
So she hid it.

960
02:08:52,400 --> 02:08:55,995
When the landlord found out, he
got mad and told her to leave.

961
02:08:58,800 --> 02:09:01,473
Now she can't stay even if she
gets rid of it.

962
02:09:02,160 --> 02:09:03,718
I'm so ashamed!

963
02:09:04,120 --> 02:09:08,352
He said he'd get the police to
throw us out on the street.

964
02:09:11,120 --> 02:09:12,599
I'm sorry, but...

965
02:09:14,560 --> 02:09:17,836
I could give you a couple dollars
to help you move.

966
02:09:18,680 --> 02:09:20,033
I can't move!

967
02:09:21,400 --> 02:09:23,197
I want you to talk to him!

968
02:09:23,800 --> 02:09:26,314
Tell him I want to stay here!

969
02:09:33,840 --> 02:09:35,319
What's your landlord's name?

970
02:09:35,800 --> 02:09:37,711
His name is Signor Roberto.

971
02:09:38,320 --> 02:09:40,595
He lives on Fourth Street, near here.

972
02:09:41,240 --> 02:09:43,993
They break the windows,
they dirty the floors...

973
02:09:45,080 --> 02:09:46,513
A real pig-sty, eh?

974
02:10:04,880 --> 02:10:08,634
My name is Vito Corleone.
Signora Colombo is a friend of my wife.

975
02:10:09,560 --> 02:10:12,677
She says she's been evicted
for no good reason.

976
02:10:13,240 --> 02:10:17,279
She's a poor widow, she has nobody
to take care of her.

977
02:10:17,560 --> 02:10:21,394
She has no relatives, no money.
All she has is this neighbourhood.

978
02:10:21,800 --> 02:10:25,236
I already rented the place
to another family.

979
02:10:30,600 --> 02:10:34,991
I told her that I'd talk to you.
That you're a reasonable man.

980
02:10:36,240 --> 02:10:39,915
She got rid of the animal that
caused all the trouble.

981
02:10:40,480 --> 02:10:42,311
So let her stay.

982
02:10:42,440 --> 02:10:43,919
Impossible.

983
02:10:44,800 --> 02:10:46,028
Are you Sicilian?

984
02:10:46,480 --> 02:10:48,038
No, I'm Calabrese.

985
02:10:48,720 --> 02:10:51,837
<i>We're practically paisan,
do me this favour.</i>

986
02:10:52,440 --> 02:10:54,954
I already rented it!
I'll look like an idiot.

987
02:10:55,960 --> 02:10:58,110
Besides, the new tenants
pay more rent.

988
02:10:58,680 --> 02:11:00,955
How much more a month?

989
02:11:02,080 --> 02:11:03,069
Five bucks.

990
02:11:07,800 --> 02:11:10,678
Here's six months increase in advance.

991
02:11:11,560 --> 02:11:14,472
But don't tell her about it.
She's very proud.

992
02:11:14,960 --> 02:11:17,394
Come see me in another six months.

993
02:11:18,840 --> 02:11:21,673
Of course, the dog stays. Right?

994
02:11:22,480 --> 02:11:23,515
The dog stays.

995
02:11:27,960 --> 02:11:31,111
Who the hell are you
to come give me orders?

996
02:11:31,520 --> 02:11:35,354
Watch out or I'll kick your Sicilian ass
right into the street!

997
02:11:37,760 --> 02:11:39,398
Do me this favour.

998
02:11:40,280 --> 02:11:42,236
I won't forget it.

999
02:11:43,080 --> 02:11:46,197
Ask your friends in the
neighbourhood about me.

1000
02:11:47,320 --> 02:11:49,834
They'll tell you I know how
to return a favour.

1001
02:11:56,440 --> 02:11:58,237
What a character!

1002
02:12:05,880 --> 02:12:10,590
That landlord is here... Roberto,
the one who owns those ratholes.

1003
02:12:17,920 --> 02:12:21,037
He's been asking all around
the neighbourhood about you.

1004
02:12:28,760 --> 02:12:31,433
I hope I'm not disturbing you,
Don Vito.

1005
02:12:32,560 --> 02:12:34,630
What can I do for you, Don Roberto?

1006
02:12:36,560 --> 02:12:38,471
What a misunderstanding! Holy Mary!

1007
02:12:39,800 --> 02:12:42,553
Of course Signora Colombo can stay!

1008
02:12:48,560 --> 02:12:51,279
I'm giving back the money you gave me.

1009
02:12:53,000 --> 02:12:58,472
<i>Un, due, three, four, five, six, tutt'!</i>

1010
02:12:59,320 --> 02:13:03,871
Because after all, Don Vito,
money isn't everything.

1011
02:13:12,160 --> 02:13:13,798
Can I sit down?

1012
02:13:16,720 --> 02:13:19,553
Your kindness to that widow
made me ashamed of myself.

1013
02:13:20,600 --> 02:13:23,433
The rent stays like before!

1014
02:13:32,680 --> 02:13:34,033
I'll even lower it.

1015
02:13:36,800 --> 02:13:37,994
I'll lower it $5.

1016
02:13:42,200 --> 02:13:43,633
I'll lower it $ 10!

1017
02:13:49,880 --> 02:13:51,836
Can I offer you some coffee?

1018
02:13:54,160 --> 02:13:58,551
I'm late for an appointment! I can't
this time! Ask me another time!

1019
02:14:03,760 --> 02:14:06,115
You'll have to excuse me for now.

1020
02:14:11,280 --> 02:14:13,316
I wish I could stay longer!

1021
02:14:19,080 --> 02:14:21,310
Just call me and I'll be here!

1022
02:14:31,960 --> 02:14:34,758
He won't be back. He'll hide out
in the Bronx!

1023
02:14:49,680 --> 02:14:54,151
- Vito, what do you think?
- We'll make a big business!

1024
02:15:01,040 --> 02:15:03,918
<i>- New York City.
- Would you speak up, please?</i>

1025
02:15:04,760 --> 02:15:06,318
<i>New York City.</i>

1026
02:15:06,440 --> 02:15:09,876
<i>- Are you the son of Vito Corleone?
- Yes, I am.</i>

1027
02:15:10,000 --> 02:15:13,470
<i>- Where was he born?
- Corleone, Sicily.</i>

1028
02:15:13,680 --> 02:15:19,312
<i>Did he at times use an alias that was
known in certain circles as Godfather?</i>

1029
02:15:20,120 --> 02:15:25,990
<i>Godfather is a term used by his friends.
One of affection and respect.</i>

1030
02:15:26,840 --> 02:15:31,072
<i>Mr Chairman, I would like to verify
the witness'statement.</i>

1031
02:15:31,200 --> 02:15:36,035
<i>For years many of my constituents
have been of Italian descent.</i>

1032
02:15:36,400 --> 02:15:38,755
<i>I've come to know them well.</i>

1033
02:15:38,880 --> 02:15:42,919
<i>They have honoured me
with their support and their friendship.</i>

1034
02:15:43,040 --> 02:15:47,955
<i>I can proudly say that some of my
very best friends are Italian-Americans.</i>

1035
02:15:49,200 --> 02:15:53,955
<i>However, Mr Chairman, unfortunately
I have to leave these proceedings</i>

1036
02:15:54,160 --> 02:15:58,153
<i>in order to preside over a very important
meeting of my own committee.</i>

1037
02:15:59,280 --> 02:16:02,113
<i>Before I leave, I do want to say this,</i>

1038
02:16:02,240 --> 02:16:06,313
<i>that these hearings on the Mafia
are in no way whatsoever</i>

1039
02:16:06,440 --> 02:16:08,954
<i>a slur upon the great Italian people.</i>

1040
02:16:09,080 --> 02:16:12,038
<i>I can state from my own knowledge
and experience</i>

1041
02:16:12,160 --> 02:16:17,075
<i>that Italian-Americans are among
the most loyal, most law-abiding,</i>

1042
02:16:17,200 --> 02:16:20,510
<i>patriotic, hard-working
American citizens in this land.</i>

1043
02:16:21,600 --> 02:16:26,355
<i>It would be a shame, Mr Chairman,
if we allowed a few rotten apples</i>

1044
02:16:26,480 --> 02:16:28,596
<i>to give a bad name to the whole barrel.</i>

1045
02:16:28,720 --> 02:16:34,078
<i>Because from the time of Christopher
Columbus to the time of Enrico Fermi</i>

1046
02:16:34,200 --> 02:16:36,156
<i>to the present day,</i>

1047
02:16:36,360 --> 02:16:40,399
<i>Italian-Americans have been pioneers
in building and defending our nation.</i>

1048
02:16:40,880 --> 02:16:45,829
<i>They are the salt of the earth, and
one of the backbones of this country.</i>

1049
02:16:51,720 --> 02:16:55,349
<i>I'm sure we all agree
with our esteemed colleague.</i>

1050
02:16:55,480 --> 02:16:59,553
<i>Mr Corleone, you have been advised
as to your legal rights.</i>

1051
02:16:59,680 --> 02:17:04,834
<i>We have testimony from
a previous witness, one Willi Cicci.</i>

1052
02:17:05,840 --> 02:17:10,072
<i>He stated that you are head of the most
powerful Mafia family in the country.</i>

1053
02:17:10,200 --> 02:17:12,350
<i>- Are you?
- No, I'm not.</i>

1054
02:17:12,480 --> 02:17:15,552
<i>He testified that you are
personally responsible</i>

1055
02:17:15,680 --> 02:17:19,468
<i>for the murder of a New York
police captain in 1947</i>

1056
02:17:19,600 --> 02:17:22,990
<i>and with him a man
named Virgil Sollozzo.</i>

1057
02:17:23,200 --> 02:17:25,555
<i>- Do you deny this?
- Yes, I do.</i>

1058
02:17:25,760 --> 02:17:28,672
<i>Is it true that in the year 1950</i>

1059
02:17:28,800 --> 02:17:33,920
<i>you devised the murder of the heads
of "the Five Families" in New York</i>

1060
02:17:34,040 --> 02:17:37,430
<i>to assume and consolidate
your nefarious power?</i>

1061
02:17:37,560 --> 02:17:40,791
<i>- It's a complete falsehood.
- Mr Questadt.</i>

1062
02:17:40,920 --> 02:17:45,357
<i>Is it true you have a controlling interest
in three major hotels in Las Vegas?</i>

1063
02:17:46,440 --> 02:17:51,389
<i>No, it's not true. I own some stock in
some of the hotels there, but very little.</i>

1064
02:17:53,960 --> 02:17:57,999
<i>I also have stock in IBM and IT& T.</i>

1065
02:17:59,080 --> 02:18:05,030
<i>Do you have any control over gambling
and narcotics in New York State?</i>

1066
02:18:05,160 --> 02:18:06,593
<i>No, I do not.</i>

1067
02:18:06,720 --> 02:18:10,110
<i>Senator, my client
would like to read a statement.</i>

1068
02:18:10,240 --> 02:18:15,519
<i>Mr Chairman, I think this statement
is totally out of order at this time.</i>

1069
02:18:15,720 --> 02:18:21,272
<i>Sir, my client has answered this
committee's questions with sincerity.</i>

1070
02:18:21,480 --> 02:18:27,112
<i>He hasn't taken the Fifth Amendment,
so this statement should be heard!</i>

1071
02:18:29,000 --> 02:18:33,755
<i>No, I'll allow Mr Corleone to read
his statement. I'll put it in the record.</i>

1072
02:18:35,560 --> 02:18:38,552
<i>In the hopes of clearing
my family name</i>

1073
02:18:38,680 --> 02:18:42,355
<i>to give my children their share
of the American way of life</i>

1074
02:18:42,480 --> 02:18:45,392
<i>without a blemish on their name
and background,</i>

1075
02:18:45,520 --> 02:18:50,469
<i>I have appeared before this committee
and given it all my cooperation.</i>

1076
02:18:51,800 --> 02:18:57,079
<i>I consider it a great personal dishonour
to have to deny that I am a criminal.</i>

1077
02:18:58,080 --> 02:19:01,277
<i>I wish to have the following noted
for the record...</i>

1078
02:19:01,480 --> 02:19:05,314
<i>That I served my country faithfully
in World War Two</i>

1079
02:19:05,440 --> 02:19:10,355
<i>and was awarded the Navy Cross
for actions in defence of my country.</i>

1080
02:19:11,240 --> 02:19:15,358
<i>That I have never been arrested
or indicted for any crime.</i>

1081
02:19:15,560 --> 02:19:19,314
<i>That no proof linking me to any
criminal conspiracy</i>

1082
02:19:19,440 --> 02:19:24,070
<i>whether it is called Mafia
or Cosa Nostra or any other name</i>

1083
02:19:24,200 --> 02:19:26,395
<i>has ever been made public.</i>

1084
02:19:26,600 --> 02:19:28,477
<i>I have not taken refuge
behind the Fifth Amendment,</i>

1085
02:19:28,600 --> 02:19:31,512
<i>although it's my right to do so.</i>

1086
02:19:34,280 --> 02:19:39,673
<i>I challenge this committee to produce
any witness or evidence against me</i>

1087
02:19:39,800 --> 02:19:45,432
<i>and if they do not, I hope they will have
the decency to clear my name</i>

1088
02:19:45,560 --> 02:19:48,996
<i>with the same publicity
with which they have besmirched it.</i>

1089
02:19:50,360 --> 02:19:55,639
<i>I'm sure we’re impressed. Particularly
with your love for our country.</i>

1090
02:19:55,840 --> 02:19:58,434
<i>We'll be in recess
until 10:00 a.m. Monday</i>

1091
02:19:58,640 --> 02:20:03,156
<i>when we will produce a witness who'll
corroborate the charges against you.</i>

1092
02:20:03,360 --> 02:20:08,115
<i>At which time you may very well
be subject to indictment for per jury.</i>

1093
02:20:08,240 --> 02:20:12,472
<i>I remind you that you’re still
under subpoena. Adjourned!</i>

1094
02:20:17,440 --> 02:20:19,032
Ten-to-one shot, you said.

1095
02:20:19,160 --> 02:20:23,676
A ten-to-one shot
he would take the Fifth, and I'd lose!

1096
02:20:23,800 --> 02:20:28,237
You sound like my bookie.
I owe that monkey my life.

1097
02:20:29,280 --> 02:20:32,636
- Well, just get a good night's sleep.
- Yeah.

1098
02:20:32,760 --> 02:20:34,796
You've got a big day tomorrow.

1099
02:20:34,920 --> 02:20:38,356
I've got you a new suit,
new shirt, new tie.

1100
02:20:39,040 --> 02:20:42,157
I'll shave you myself in the morning.

1101
02:20:42,360 --> 02:20:46,239
You'll look respectable for 50 million
of your fellow Americans.

1102
02:20:46,360 --> 02:20:51,275
Tomorrow... My life won't be worth
a nickel after tomorrow.

1103
02:20:52,280 --> 02:20:55,716
Come on! I saw this 19 times.

1104
02:20:56,800 --> 02:21:00,395
You've got a great home here,
for the rest of your life.

1105
02:21:00,600 --> 02:21:03,558
Nobody gets near you,
you're not going anywhere.

1106
02:21:03,760 --> 02:21:08,436
That's great. Beautiful.
Some deal I made.

1107
02:21:08,560 --> 02:21:11,233
You'll live like a king. You'll be a hero.

1108
02:21:11,360 --> 02:21:13,999
You'll live better here
than most people outside.

1109
02:21:14,200 --> 02:21:16,350
Some deal!

1110
02:21:18,880 --> 02:21:22,555
Alive. Pentangeli is alive.

1111
02:21:24,280 --> 02:21:29,308
- How did they get their hands on him?
- Roth. He engineered it, Michael.

1112
02:21:30,200 --> 02:21:32,430
When Frankie went to make a deal with
the Rosato brothers

1113
02:21:32,560 --> 02:21:34,471
they tried to kill him.

1114
02:21:34,600 --> 02:21:36,716
He thought you double-crossed him.

1115
02:21:37,760 --> 02:21:40,911
Our people with the detectives
said he was half dead, scared

1116
02:21:41,040 --> 02:21:43,600
and shouted that you'd turned on him.

1117
02:21:43,920 --> 02:21:47,879
They already had him on possession,
bookmaking, murder one and more.

1118
02:21:49,680 --> 02:21:55,118
The FBI has him airtight.
He's on an army base, 24 hour guards.

1119
02:21:55,320 --> 02:21:59,996
We can't get to him. You've opened
yourself to five counts of perjury.

1120
02:22:02,400 --> 02:22:05,233
What about Fredo?
What does he know?

1121
02:22:05,360 --> 02:22:08,796
He says he doesn't know anything,
and I believe him.

1122
02:22:09,000 --> 02:22:13,073
Roth, he played this one beautifully.

1123
02:22:20,160 --> 02:22:22,799
I'm going to talk to Fredo.

1124
02:23:00,480 --> 02:23:02,994
I haven't got a lot to say, Mike.

1125
02:23:04,560 --> 02:23:06,915
We have time.

1126
02:23:07,120 --> 02:23:10,078
I was kept pretty much in the dark.

1127
02:23:11,400 --> 02:23:13,391
I didn't know all that much.

1128
02:23:14,360 --> 02:23:18,956
What about now? Is there anything
you can help me out with?

1129
02:23:19,560 --> 02:23:21,676
Anything you can tell me now?

1130
02:23:23,560 --> 02:23:26,074
They've got Pentangeli.

1131
02:23:40,200 --> 02:23:43,715
I didn't know
it was going to be a hit, Mike.

1132
02:23:43,920 --> 02:23:46,070
I swear to God I didn't know.

1133
02:23:48,800 --> 02:23:52,918
Johnny Ola bumped into me
in Beverly Hills.

1134
02:23:54,720 --> 02:23:57,598
He said that he wanted to talk.

1135
02:23:59,160 --> 02:24:05,030
He said that you and Roth
were in on a big deal together.

1136
02:24:07,520 --> 02:24:11,638
And that there was something in it
for me if I could help him out.

1137
02:24:11,760 --> 02:24:15,469
He said that you were being tough
on the negotiations

1138
02:24:15,600 --> 02:24:19,718
but if they could get a little help
and close the deal fast,

1139
02:24:21,280 --> 02:24:23,669
it would be good for the family.

1140
02:24:25,200 --> 02:24:29,478
And you believed that story?
You believed that?

1141
02:24:29,680 --> 02:24:33,559
He said there was something in it
for me, on my own!

1142
02:24:33,680 --> 02:24:37,593
- I've always taken care of you, Fredo.
- Taken care of me?

1143
02:24:38,920 --> 02:24:41,559
You're my kid brother!
You take care of me?

1144
02:24:42,560 --> 02:24:46,439
Did you ever think about that?
Did you ever once think about that?

1145
02:24:47,520 --> 02:24:51,479
"Send Fredo off to do this,
send Fredo off to do that!"

1146
02:24:52,160 --> 02:24:56,438
"Let Fredo take care of some
Mickey Mouse nightclub somewhere."

1147
02:24:56,560 --> 02:24:59,472
"Let Fredo fetch somebody
at the airport!"

1148
02:24:59,600 --> 02:25:02,512
I'm your older brother,
but was stepped over!

1149
02:25:02,720 --> 02:25:06,269
- It's the way Pop wanted it.
- It's not the way I wanted it!

1150
02:25:07,080 --> 02:25:11,756
I can handle things, I'm smart!
Not like everybody says.

1151
02:25:11,960 --> 02:25:15,635
Like dumb. I'm smart
and I want respect!

1152
02:25:23,040 --> 02:25:27,955
Is there anything you can tell me about
this investigation? Anything more?

1153
02:25:35,680 --> 02:25:41,437
The Senate lawyer, Questadt.
He belongs to Roth.

1154
02:25:50,760 --> 02:25:52,432
Fredo,

1155
02:25:54,840 --> 02:25:57,308
you're nothing to me now.

1156
02:25:59,080 --> 02:26:01,389
Not a brother, not a friend.

1157
02:26:03,160 --> 02:26:06,038
I don't want to know you,
or what you do.

1158
02:26:07,160 --> 02:26:09,993
I don't want to see you at the hotels.

1159
02:26:10,120 --> 02:26:12,509
I don't want you near my house.

1160
02:26:14,440 --> 02:26:18,877
When you see our mother, I want
to know in advance, so I won't be there.

1161
02:26:20,440 --> 02:26:21,998
You understand?

1162
02:26:31,400 --> 02:26:33,231
Mikey.

1163
02:26:39,600 --> 02:26:43,229
I don't want anything to happen to him
while my mother's alive.

1164
02:27:31,160 --> 02:27:34,470
There's more people
than at a ballgame in here.

1165
02:27:34,680 --> 02:27:38,639
- Hey, there's Willi Cicci!
- Frankie Five-Angels...

1166
02:27:57,240 --> 02:27:59,674
<i>This committee will come to order!</i>

1167
02:28:02,360 --> 02:28:05,033
<i>- State your name, please.
- Frank Pentangeli.</i>

1168
02:28:05,160 --> 02:28:08,675
<i>- Where were you born?
- Partinico, it's outside of Palermo.</i>

1169
02:28:08,880 --> 02:28:10,791
<i>Where do you live now?</i>

1170
02:28:11,000 --> 02:28:15,949
<i>I live in an army barracks
with the FBI guys.</i>

1171
02:28:17,000 --> 02:28:21,278
<i>We have here a witness
that will further testify</i>

1172
02:28:21,400 --> 02:28:27,475
<i>to Michael Corleone's rule of a criminal
empire that controls all gambling.</i>

1173
02:28:27,800 --> 02:28:32,430
<i>This witness has had no buffer
between himself and Michael Corleone.</i>

1174
02:28:32,560 --> 02:28:35,597
<i>He can corroborate enough charges</i>

1175
02:28:35,720 --> 02:28:40,157
<i>for us to recommend a charge
of per jury against Michael Corleone.</i>

1176
02:28:40,360 --> 02:28:42,191
- Senator.
- Thank you, Chairman.

1177
02:28:43,560 --> 02:28:45,039
<i>Mr Pentangeli.</i>

1178
02:28:46,200 --> 02:28:51,593
<i>Mr Pentangeli. Were you a member
of the Corleone family?</i>

1179
02:28:51,800 --> 02:28:56,590
<i>Did you serve under Caporegime,
Peter Clemenza,</i>

1180
02:28:56,720 --> 02:29:01,032
<i>and under Vito Corleone,
also known as the Godfather?</i>

1181
02:29:06,560 --> 02:29:09,028
<i>I never knew any Godfather.</i>

1182
02:29:11,520 --> 02:29:13,511
<i>I have my own family.</i>

1183
02:29:16,840 --> 02:29:19,229
<i>Mr Pentangeli, you...</i>

1184
02:29:19,440 --> 02:29:23,592
<i>You are contradicting
your own sworn statement.</i>

1185
02:29:23,800 --> 02:29:27,315
<i>I ask you again, sir,
here and now under oath...</i>

1186
02:29:27,440 --> 02:29:31,479
<i>were you at any time a member of
a crime organisation</i>

1187
02:29:31,600 --> 02:29:33,352
<i>led by Michael Corleone?</i>

1188
02:29:33,480 --> 02:29:36,313
I don't know nothing about that!

1189
02:29:39,240 --> 02:29:43,028
I was in the olive oil business
with his father

1190
02:29:43,160 --> 02:29:45,628
but that was a long time ago.

1191
02:29:46,680 --> 02:29:49,592
<i>We have a sworn affidavit.</i>

1192
02:29:51,240 --> 02:29:55,756
<i>Your sworn affidavit, that you murdered
on the orders of Michael Corleone.</i>

1193
02:29:55,880 --> 02:30:00,158
<i>Do you deny this confession, and do
you realise what will happen if you do?</i>

1194
02:30:00,280 --> 02:30:03,272
<i>The FBI guys promised me a deal</i>

1195
02:30:03,440 --> 02:30:08,833
<i>so I made up a lot of stuff about
Michael Corleone, just to please them.</i>

1196
02:30:09,040 --> 02:30:12,828
<i>But it was all lies. Everything!</i>

1197
02:30:13,520 --> 02:30:15,670
<i>They kept saying,</i>

1198
02:30:15,880 --> 02:30:20,670
<i>"Michael Corleone did this"
and "Michael Corleone did that".</i>

1199
02:30:22,000 --> 02:30:25,788
<i>So I said, "Yeah, sure. Why not?"</i>

1200
02:30:26,000 --> 02:30:31,916
<i>Mr Corleone, would you kindly identify
the gentleman sitting to your left?</i>

1201
02:30:32,040 --> 02:30:34,110
I can answer that.

1202
02:30:34,320 --> 02:30:36,550
His name is Vincenzo Pentangeli.

1203
02:30:37,560 --> 02:30:41,678
<i>- Is he related to the witness?
- He is, I believe, his brother.</i>

1204
02:30:42,040 --> 02:30:46,431
<i>- Will he come forward and be sworn?
- He doesn't understand English.</i>

1205
02:30:46,640 --> 02:30:49,518
He came at his own expense
to aid his brother.

1206
02:30:50,360 --> 02:30:53,875
He's not under subpoena
and has an impeccable reputation.

1207
02:30:54,000 --> 02:30:57,629
<i>- He knows nothing about this?
- To my knowledge, nothing.</i>

1208
02:30:57,760 --> 02:31:02,356
<i>I'm going to find out what happened!
This committee is now adjourned.</i>

1209
02:31:02,480 --> 02:31:04,436
<i>- The witness is excused.
- Senator!</i>

1210
02:31:05,520 --> 02:31:08,990
Senator! This committee
owes an apology!

1211
02:31:09,520 --> 02:31:13,308
This committee owes an apology.
Apology, Senator!

1212
02:31:39,880 --> 02:31:43,668
- Michael, excuse me.
- Hello, darling.

1213
02:31:44,120 --> 02:31:47,396
The children are outside. We're going.

1214
02:31:48,720 --> 02:31:51,234
What do you mean?
We're leaving tomorrow.

1215
02:31:52,080 --> 02:31:54,389
Rocco?

1216
02:31:55,440 --> 02:31:57,874
I'll be in my room, Mike.

1217
02:32:00,560 --> 02:32:03,472
Michael, I'm not going back to Nevada.

1218
02:32:03,600 --> 02:32:06,876
I brought the children
to say goodbye to you.

1219
02:32:09,840 --> 02:32:12,274
I'm very happy for you.

1220
02:32:12,480 --> 02:32:16,758
I always knew you were too smart
to let any of them beat you.

1221
02:32:18,160 --> 02:32:22,551
- Why don't you sit down?
- No, I'm not going to stay long.

1222
02:32:22,760 --> 02:32:26,275
There are some things
I'd like to talk to you about.

1223
02:32:26,480 --> 02:32:31,270
Things that have been on my mind,
changes I want to make.

1224
02:32:31,480 --> 02:32:34,392
I think it's too late for changes, Michael.

1225
02:32:35,560 --> 02:32:40,031
- I wasn't going to say anything...
- What do you mean, "too late"?

1226
02:32:45,200 --> 02:32:47,714
What really happened with Pentangeli?

1227
02:32:53,360 --> 02:32:58,275
- His brother came and helped him.
- I didn't even know he had a brother.

1228
02:32:58,480 --> 02:33:00,198
Where is he now?

1229
02:33:01,520 --> 02:33:04,034
He's on a plane, back to Sicily.

1230
02:33:04,720 --> 02:33:07,075
All he had to do was show his face.

1231
02:33:08,720 --> 02:33:13,316
It was between the brothers, Kay.
I had nothing to do with it.

1232
02:33:20,880 --> 02:33:24,589
I don't want you going!
Not you, not the kids. No.

1233
02:33:25,680 --> 02:33:29,468
You're my wife and my children.
I love you and won't allow it.

1234
02:33:30,760 --> 02:33:34,389
You say you love me,
but talk about allowing me to leave!

1235
02:33:34,600 --> 02:33:38,115
Things between men and women
will not change.

1236
02:33:38,320 --> 02:33:42,029
You've become blind!
Look what's happened to us.

1237
02:33:42,240 --> 02:33:47,155
- Look what's happened to our son!
- Nothing's happened to him. He's fine!

1238
02:33:47,360 --> 02:33:50,397
- Anthony is not fine!
- I don't want to hear about it.

1239
02:33:50,600 --> 02:33:54,309
- Anthony is...
- I don't want to hear about it!

1240
02:33:55,600 --> 02:33:57,556
Over!

1241
02:34:09,120 --> 02:34:12,510
At this moment
I feel no love for you at all.

1242
02:34:13,640 --> 02:34:18,395
I never thought that would ever happen,
but it has.

1243
02:34:32,200 --> 02:34:34,156
Kay...

1244
02:34:36,920 --> 02:34:38,956
We're leaving tomorrow.

1245
02:34:39,680 --> 02:34:42,672
Why don't you take the kids
back to their room?

1246
02:34:42,800 --> 02:34:48,318
- Michael, you haven't heard me.
- Kay, what do you want from me?

1247
02:34:48,640 --> 02:34:54,715
Do you expect me to let you go,
to let you take my children from me?

1248
02:34:55,520 --> 02:35:00,833
Don't you know me? Don't you know
that that's an impossibility?

1249
02:35:00,960 --> 02:35:04,635
That I'd use all my power
to keep that from happening?

1250
02:35:05,480 --> 02:35:07,710
Don't you know that?

1251
02:35:09,360 --> 02:35:11,157
Kay...

1252
02:35:13,960 --> 02:35:18,351
In time, you'll feel differently.

1253
02:35:19,880 --> 02:35:22,678
You'll be glad I stopped you now.

1254
02:35:24,520 --> 02:35:26,397
I know that.

1255
02:35:28,360 --> 02:35:31,636
I know you blame me
for losing the baby.

1256
02:35:33,440 --> 02:35:34,395
Yes.

1257
02:35:35,680 --> 02:35:38,240
I know what that meant to you.

1258
02:35:40,240 --> 02:35:42,231
I'll make it up to you, Kay.

1259
02:35:43,120 --> 02:35:45,839
I swear I'll make it up to you. I'll...

1260
02:35:47,080 --> 02:35:48,911
I'm going to change.

1261
02:35:50,320 --> 02:35:54,313
I'll change. I've learnt that I have
the strength to change.

1262
02:35:56,440 --> 02:35:59,238
Then you'll forget about
this miscarriage

1263
02:36:00,120 --> 02:36:04,750
and we'll have another child.
And we'll go on, you and I.

1264
02:36:06,080 --> 02:36:10,039
- We'll go on.
- Oh, Michael!

1265
02:36:11,160 --> 02:36:13,390
Michael, you are blind.

1266
02:36:15,200 --> 02:36:17,395
It wasn't a miscarriage.

1267
02:36:19,400 --> 02:36:20,799
It was an abortion.

1268
02:36:22,640 --> 02:36:27,589
An abortion, Michael.
Just like our marriage is an abortion.

1269
02:36:28,520 --> 02:36:31,796
Something that's unholy and evil!

1270
02:36:33,360 --> 02:36:35,555
I didn't want your son, Michael!

1271
02:36:36,400 --> 02:36:40,075
I wouldn't bring another one
of your sons into this world!

1272
02:36:41,960 --> 02:36:44,269
It was an abortion, Michael.

1273
02:36:44,400 --> 02:36:49,793
It was a son and I had it killed
because this must all end!

1274
02:36:51,360 --> 02:36:55,239
I know now that it's over. I knew it then.

1275
02:36:56,600 --> 02:37:01,720
There would be no way, Michael,
no way you could ever forgive me.

1276
02:37:01,840 --> 02:37:06,311
Not with this Sicilian thing
that's been going on for 2,000...

1277
02:37:13,920 --> 02:37:16,673
- You won't take my children.
- I will.

1278
02:37:16,800 --> 02:37:20,918
- You won't take my children!
- They're my children too.

1279
02:38:47,080 --> 02:38:50,470
Fredo, give this to Grandmother.

1280
02:40:59,760 --> 02:41:01,671
Don Ciccio, it's Tommasino.

1281
02:41:05,440 --> 02:41:08,318
Allow me the honour of
introducing someone.

1282
02:41:08,680 --> 02:41:11,353
My partner in America, in New York.

1283
02:41:12,040 --> 02:41:13,758
His name is Vito Corleone.

1284
02:41:14,480 --> 02:41:16,869
We'll send him olive oil from here.

1285
02:41:17,720 --> 02:41:19,039
To his company in America.

1286
02:41:23,680 --> 02:41:26,797
They're olive oil importers, Don Ciccio.

1287
02:41:36,160 --> 02:41:41,518
We'd like your blessing, and your
permission to start work.

1288
02:41:42,600 --> 02:41:45,353
Where is this young man
from New York?

1289
02:41:48,600 --> 02:41:51,558
Have him come closer.

1290
02:41:52,560 --> 02:41:55,279
I can't see him so good.

1291
02:42:02,040 --> 02:42:05,510
My respects, Don Ciccio.
Give me your blessing.

1292
02:42:07,920 --> 02:42:09,512
Bless you!

1293
02:42:11,360 --> 02:42:12,839
What's your name?

1294
02:42:18,080 --> 02:42:21,072
You took the name of this town!

1295
02:42:21,640 --> 02:42:23,278
And what's your father's name?

1296
02:42:23,440 --> 02:42:26,910
His name was... Antonio Andolini.

1297
02:42:27,320 --> 02:42:30,790
Louder, I don't hear so good.

1298
02:42:34,120 --> 02:42:37,192
My father's name was
Antonio Andolini...

1299
02:42:37,520 --> 02:42:40,080
...and this is for you!

1300
02:43:58,680 --> 02:44:01,148
Michael, say goodbye.

1301
02:45:01,840 --> 02:45:03,159
Hi, Al.

1302
02:45:14,800 --> 02:45:17,633
Can I speak with you
for a second, Tom?

1303
02:45:25,280 --> 02:45:26,872
Tom, where's Mike?

1304
02:45:28,080 --> 02:45:30,036
Waiting for you to leave.

1305
02:45:32,560 --> 02:45:36,838
- Can I talk with him?
- Sorry, Fredo. No chance.

1306
02:45:37,480 --> 02:45:40,597
- Can I see him?
- He's in the boathouse.

1307
02:45:53,200 --> 02:45:55,430
Michael, it's Connie.

1308
02:46:15,880 --> 02:46:17,313
Michael...

1309
02:46:20,280 --> 02:46:23,556
I'd like to stay close to home now,
if it's all right.

1310
02:46:31,800 --> 02:46:33,916
Is Kay coming?

1311
02:46:36,320 --> 02:46:37,878
No.

1312
02:46:45,680 --> 02:46:48,399
Fredo's in the house with Mama.

1313
02:46:48,520 --> 02:46:52,229
He asked for you
and Tom said you wouldn't see him.

1314
02:46:55,760 --> 02:46:57,512
That's right.

1315
02:47:00,280 --> 02:47:03,477
Kids, why don't you go outside
for a while?

1316
02:47:06,920 --> 02:47:09,150
Please, I want to talk to you.

1317
02:47:20,280 --> 02:47:24,114
Michael, I hated you for so many years.

1318
02:47:24,560 --> 02:47:29,634
I think I did things to myself,
to hurt myself, so that you'd know

1319
02:47:32,800 --> 02:47:34,756
that I could hurt you.

1320
02:47:40,680 --> 02:47:44,798
You were just being strong for all of us,
the way Papa was.

1321
02:47:45,440 --> 02:47:47,192
And I forgive you.

1322
02:47:51,720 --> 02:47:53,551
Can't you forgive Fredo?

1323
02:47:54,600 --> 02:47:58,991
He's so sweet,
and helpless without you.

1324
02:48:05,120 --> 02:48:08,749
You need me.
I want to take care of you now.

1325
02:48:18,240 --> 02:48:19,673
Connie.

1326
02:49:57,760 --> 02:50:00,194
Tom, sit down.

1327
02:50:11,520 --> 02:50:15,035
Our friend and business partner,
Hyman Roth, is in the news.

1328
02:50:16,400 --> 02:50:20,791
- Did you hear about it?
- I hear that he's in Israel.

1329
02:50:21,400 --> 02:50:25,757
The High Court in Israel
turned down his request to live there.

1330
02:50:25,960 --> 02:50:29,396
His passport's been invalidated,
except to return here.

1331
02:50:29,520 --> 02:50:32,114
He landed in Buenos Aires yesterday.

1332
02:50:32,440 --> 02:50:36,115
He offered them a million dollars
if they'd let him live there.

1333
02:50:37,120 --> 02:50:40,908
- They turned him down.
- He's going to try Panama.

1334
02:50:41,040 --> 02:50:45,477
Panama won't take him.
Not for a million, not for ten million.

1335
02:50:45,920 --> 02:50:50,357
His condition is reported as terminal.
He's only got six months left.

1336
02:50:50,560 --> 02:50:53,393
He's had the same heart attack
for 20 years.

1337
02:50:53,600 --> 02:50:57,559
- That plane goes to Miami.
- That's right. That's where I want it met.

1338
02:50:58,720 --> 02:51:03,794
Impossible. They'll turn him over to the
Internal Revenue, Customs and FBI.

1339
02:51:04,000 --> 02:51:07,072
It's not impossible.
Nothing's impossible.

1340
02:51:07,200 --> 02:51:08,553
It would be
like trying to kill the President.

1341
02:51:08,680 --> 02:51:12,912
- There's no way we can get to him!
- Tom, you surprise me.

1342
02:51:15,680 --> 02:51:19,116
If anything in this life is certain,

1343
02:51:19,240 --> 02:51:22,277
if history has taught us anything,

1344
02:51:22,400 --> 02:51:24,834
it's that you can kill anyone.

1345
02:51:30,000 --> 02:51:34,676
- Rocco?
- Difficult. Not impossible.

1346
02:51:35,040 --> 02:51:36,632
Good.

1347
02:51:39,040 --> 02:51:42,476
Why did you ask me if something
was wrong when I came in?

1348
02:51:46,040 --> 02:51:51,637
I thought you were going to tell me that
you were moving your family to Vegas

1349
02:51:53,000 --> 02:51:56,675
and that you'd been offered the Vice
Presidency of the Houstan hotels there.

1350
02:51:58,760 --> 02:52:03,356
- I thought you'd tell me that.
- Must I tell you every offer I turn down?

1351
02:52:07,440 --> 02:52:10,079
- Let's do business.
- All right.

1352
02:52:11,920 --> 02:52:14,798
Just consider this, Michael.
Just consider it.

1353
02:52:16,000 --> 02:52:18,036
Roth and the Rosatos are on the run.

1354
02:52:18,160 --> 02:52:20,549
Are they worth it,
are they strong enough?

1355
02:52:21,040 --> 02:52:25,716
Is it worth it? You've won.
Do you want to wipe everybody out?

1356
02:52:25,840 --> 02:52:30,868
I don't feel I have to wipe everybody
out, Tom. Just my enemies, that's all.

1357
02:52:38,320 --> 02:52:40,880
Are you with me in these things,
or what?

1358
02:52:42,920 --> 02:52:48,119
Because if not, you can take your wife,
your family and your mistress

1359
02:52:48,320 --> 02:52:51,278
and move them all to Las Vegas.

1360
02:52:54,280 --> 02:52:59,070
Why do you hurt me, Michael? I've
always been loyal to you. What is this?

1361
02:53:03,520 --> 02:53:05,078
So... you're staying?

1362
02:53:07,080 --> 02:53:09,275
Yes, I'm staying.

1363
02:53:11,800 --> 02:53:13,791
What do you want me to do?

1364
02:53:14,320 --> 02:53:16,231
Hey, Anthony.

1365
02:53:16,760 --> 02:53:21,197
How would you like it if I taught you
how to catch the really big fish?

1366
02:53:21,320 --> 02:53:23,629
- Would you like that?
- Okay.

1367
02:53:23,840 --> 02:53:26,308
You know, when I was your age,

1368
02:53:26,840 --> 02:53:33,393
I went out fishing with all my brothers
and my father. Everybody.

1369
02:53:34,560 --> 02:53:37,870
I was the only one that caught a fish.

1370
02:53:38,720 --> 02:53:42,713
Nobody else could catch one.
Do you know how I did it?

1371
02:53:44,320 --> 02:53:47,869
Every time I put the line in the water
I said a Hail Mary

1372
02:53:48,080 --> 02:53:51,516
and every time I said a Hail Mary,
I caught a fish.

1373
02:53:53,920 --> 02:53:57,879
Do you believe that? It's true.
That's the secret.

1374
02:53:59,880 --> 02:54:03,509
- Do you want to try it out on the lake?
- Okay.

1375
02:54:05,280 --> 02:54:06,349
What else have you got?

1376
02:54:32,000 --> 02:54:34,434
Everything will be okay.

1377
02:54:34,640 --> 02:54:38,349
- Did my brother go back?
- Yeah, don't worry.

1378
02:54:38,560 --> 02:54:43,236
He's ten times tougher than me,
my brother. He's old-fashioned.

1379
02:54:44,280 --> 02:54:47,431
He didn't want dinner,
just wanted to go home.

1380
02:54:47,560 --> 02:54:52,315
That's my brother! Nothing could get
him away from that two-mule town.

1381
02:54:52,520 --> 02:54:56,149
He could have been big here.
He could have had his own family.

1382
02:55:01,240 --> 02:55:03,037
Tom,

1383
02:55:03,760 --> 02:55:06,194
what do I do now?

1384
02:55:06,920 --> 02:55:08,797
Frankie.

1385
02:55:13,200 --> 02:55:17,034
You were always interested
in politics and history.

1386
02:55:18,480 --> 02:55:21,756
I remember you talking about Hitler
back in '33.

1387
02:55:21,960 --> 02:55:25,396
Yeah, I still read a lot.
I get good stuff in there.

1388
02:55:27,880 --> 02:55:33,398
You were around the old-timers, who
built the organisation of the families,

1389
02:55:33,520 --> 02:55:38,674
basing them on the old Roman legions,
with "regimes," "capos" and "soldiers".

1390
02:55:39,920 --> 02:55:43,754
- And it worked.
- Yeah, it worked.

1391
02:55:44,520 --> 02:55:47,830
Those were the great old days,
you know.

1392
02:55:48,040 --> 02:55:51,032
We was like the Roman Empire.

1393
02:55:51,160 --> 02:55:54,436
The Corleone family
was like the Roman Empire.

1394
02:55:56,760 --> 02:55:58,591
Yeah,

1395
02:55:58,800 --> 02:56:01,030
it was once.

1396
02:56:05,320 --> 02:56:06,753
Frankie.

1397
02:56:16,840 --> 02:56:20,196
When a plot
against the Emperor failed

1398
02:56:21,440 --> 02:56:24,716
the plotters were always
given a chance

1399
02:56:26,640 --> 02:56:30,030
to let their families keep their fortunes.
Right?

1400
02:56:30,160 --> 02:56:32,196
Only the rich guys.

1401
02:56:32,320 --> 02:56:37,030
The little guys got knocked off and all
their estates went to the Emperors.

1402
02:56:37,240 --> 02:56:42,189
Unless they went home and killed
themselves, then nothing happened.

1403
02:56:43,360 --> 02:56:47,433
And their families were taken care of.

1404
02:56:49,040 --> 02:56:52,237
That was a good break, a nice deal.

1405
02:56:52,920 --> 02:56:54,319
Yeah.

1406
02:56:55,200 --> 02:56:57,191
They went home

1407
02:56:58,360 --> 02:57:01,193
and sat in a hot bath

1408
02:57:01,400 --> 02:57:03,755
opened up their veins

1409
02:57:03,960 --> 02:57:06,520
and bled to death.

1410
02:57:07,680 --> 02:57:11,639
And sometimes they had a little party
before they did it.

1411
02:57:16,640 --> 02:57:20,235
Don't worry about anything,
Frankie Five-Angels.

1412
02:57:20,440 --> 02:57:23,591
Thanks, Tom. Thanks.

1413
02:57:41,320 --> 02:57:44,278
<i>- See you, Tom.
- Addio, Frankie.</i>

1414
02:57:54,840 --> 02:57:57,752
Kay. You have to go.

1415
02:57:59,520 --> 02:58:02,671
- So pretty...
- Kay, please hurry. He's coming.

1416
02:58:11,160 --> 02:58:14,789
Anthony. Kiss Mama goodbye.

1417
02:58:17,320 --> 02:58:19,959
Anthony, kiss your mother goodbye!

1418
02:58:20,160 --> 02:58:24,995
Anthony, say goodbye to Mama.
Anthony. I love you, Anthony.

1419
02:58:26,120 --> 02:58:28,395
Kay, please.

1420
02:58:31,200 --> 02:58:33,031
All right.

1421
02:58:45,800 --> 02:58:48,030
Mary, come here.

1422
02:58:55,000 --> 02:58:56,433
Anthony.

1423
02:58:56,560 --> 02:58:59,393
Anthony, please. Kiss me once.

1424
03:00:34,520 --> 03:00:36,511
Easy.

1425
03:00:42,000 --> 03:00:44,912
Anthony! Anthony!

1426
03:00:45,080 --> 03:00:47,958
- He's here, we're going fishing.
- No!

1427
03:00:48,160 --> 03:00:51,311
Michael wants to take him to Reno now.

1428
03:00:51,440 --> 03:00:53,317
Shit!

1429
03:00:54,520 --> 03:00:57,796
Okay, kid, you have to go to Reno
with your pop.

1430
03:00:58,760 --> 03:01:02,514
- I'll take you fishing tomorrow, okay?
- Okay.

1431
03:01:06,040 --> 03:01:07,519
Hey, Anthony.

1432
03:01:07,640 --> 03:01:11,758
Listen, I'll catch one for you in secret.

1433
03:01:15,680 --> 03:01:16,954
Let's go.

1434
03:01:54,560 --> 03:01:58,519
- Mr Roth, I must take you into custody.
- I understand.

1435
03:01:58,720 --> 03:02:01,678
What's your reaction
to the Israeli High Court ruling?

1436
03:02:01,880 --> 03:02:04,519
I'm a retired investor on a pension.

1437
03:02:04,720 --> 03:02:09,350
I went to Israel to live there as a Jew,
in the twilight of my life.

1438
03:02:15,480 --> 03:02:18,916
Hey, Frankie! Come on out,
let's play some Hearts.

1439
03:02:26,800 --> 03:02:28,392
Frankie!

1440
03:02:43,680 --> 03:02:46,399
Is it true you're worth
over 300 million dollars?

1441
03:02:46,600 --> 03:02:50,036
I'm a retired investor,
living on a pension.

1442
03:02:50,240 --> 03:02:53,596
I came home to vote
in the presidential election

1443
03:02:53,800 --> 03:02:57,031
because they wouldn't give me
an absentee ballot.

1444
03:03:08,920 --> 03:03:11,195
Jesus Christ.

1445
03:03:12,240 --> 03:03:16,631
Hail Mary, full of grace.
The Lord is with thee.

1446
03:03:18,120 --> 03:03:20,554
Blessed art thou amongst women.

1447
03:03:21,360 --> 03:03:24,318
Blessed is the fruit of thy womb, Jesus.

1448
03:03:25,520 --> 03:03:29,513
Holy Mary, Mother of God,
pray for us sinners.

1449
03:04:09,720 --> 03:04:14,635
Hey! Everybody, pay attention.
This is my friend Carlo Rizzi.

1450
03:04:15,480 --> 03:04:18,040
- You know my brother Fredo.
- Sure.

1451
03:04:18,240 --> 03:04:22,791
This is my stepbrother Tom,
and that's his girl Theresa.

1452
03:04:22,920 --> 03:04:26,037
This cute little thing is my sister Connie.

1453
03:04:26,160 --> 03:04:28,879
Say hello to Carlo.
He's good-looking, isn't he?

1454
03:04:29,000 --> 03:04:30,433
Yes.

1455
03:04:30,640 --> 03:04:34,474
The droopy thing is Mike.
We call him Joe College.

1456
03:04:35,000 --> 03:04:38,629
Sit down. Talk to each other.

1457
03:04:38,840 --> 03:04:40,956
Hey, Mr Einstein...

1458
03:04:44,200 --> 03:04:46,555
- The cake.
- Sally, get in here!

1459
03:04:46,760 --> 03:04:48,751
- I was scared.
- Come on.

1460
03:04:49,440 --> 03:04:52,591
- Where's your father?
- Christmas shopping.

1461
03:04:52,800 --> 03:04:55,030
Let's see that thing.

1462
03:04:56,720 --> 03:04:58,517
That's nice!

1463
03:04:58,640 --> 03:05:02,315
- Should I put the candles on now?
- Yeah. You help her, Carlo.

1464
03:05:03,400 --> 03:05:06,358
- What is that? Rum?
- Yeah.

1465
03:05:11,200 --> 03:05:14,317
Don't touch the antipasto
until Pop sees it.

1466
03:05:14,520 --> 03:05:17,034
He's not ugly...

1467
03:05:22,360 --> 03:05:28,276
What do you think of the nerve of those
Japs? Bombing us on Pop's birthday.

1468
03:05:28,400 --> 03:05:31,676
They didn't know it was Pop's birthday.

1469
03:05:31,800 --> 03:05:34,314
Not surprising after the oil embargo.

1470
03:05:34,520 --> 03:05:38,798
They've got no right dropping bombs!
Are you a Jap-lover?

1471
03:05:39,000 --> 03:05:42,436
- 30,000 enlisted this morning.
- Bunch of saps...

1472
03:05:42,640 --> 03:05:45,950
- Why are they saps?
- Let's not talk about the war.

1473
03:05:47,080 --> 03:05:48,798
You talk to Carlo.

1474
03:05:50,720 --> 03:05:54,156
Only saps risk their lives for strangers.

1475
03:05:54,280 --> 03:05:57,556
- That's Pop talking.
- You're right, that's Pop talking!

1476
03:05:57,680 --> 03:06:01,309
- They risk their lives for their country.
- Country isn't your blood.

1477
03:06:01,440 --> 03:06:07,072
- I don't feel that way.
- Then quit college and join the army!

1478
03:06:07,200 --> 03:06:08,553
I did.

1479
03:06:09,520 --> 03:06:12,318
I've enlisted in the Marines.

1480
03:06:14,520 --> 03:06:17,592
- Why didn't you come to us?
- What do you mean?

1481
03:06:17,720 --> 03:06:21,713
- Pop managed to get you a deferment.
- I didn't ask for it.

1482
03:06:22,480 --> 03:06:24,436
I didn't want it.

1483
03:06:25,600 --> 03:06:27,909
Come on! Knock it off!

1484
03:06:28,120 --> 03:06:31,635
- Punk!
- Sonny, sit down.

1485
03:06:34,520 --> 03:06:37,830
Mommy, Daddy's fighting again!

1486
03:06:40,880 --> 03:06:43,440
Go and show Carlo the tree.

1487
03:06:53,400 --> 03:06:54,913

Don't encourage him!

1492
03:07:07,280 --> 03:07:09,840

Many times he and I have talked
about your future.

Surprise!

1503

<i>For he's a jolly good fellow
For he's a jolly good fellow</i>

1504
03:08:14,280 --> 03:08:17,875
<i>That nobody can deny
Nobody can deny...</i>
