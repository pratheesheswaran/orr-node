1
00:00:49,514 --> 00:00:50,481
Mom!

2
00:00:52,216 --> 00:00:54,013
Mom! Help me.

3
00:00:57,221 --> 00:00:58,188
What is it?

4
00:00:58,289 --> 00:01:01,122
I wasn't dreaming, Walt.
I didn't imagine it.

5
00:01:01,225 --> 00:01:04,353
I heard him. I heard him. I heard him.
I heard Chris.

6
00:01:04,629 --> 00:01:07,223
- I heard him!
- I know.

7
00:01:07,465 --> 00:01:09,956
No. I wasn't imagining it, Walt.

8
00:01:10,401 --> 00:01:12,892
No, I did. He's... He's...

9
00:01:14,138 --> 00:01:16,333
- I heard him!
- Billie.

10
00:03:43,321 --> 00:03:45,346
That's about as far as I can get you.

11
00:03:45,456 --> 00:03:47,048
All right. Thank you.

12
00:04:01,005 --> 00:04:04,338
- You left all your shit on my dash.
- Keep it.

13
00:04:05,343 --> 00:04:06,810
Suit yourself.

14
00:04:07,445 --> 00:04:08,878
Thanks again.

15
00:04:10,882 --> 00:04:12,713
Hey, hold on a minute.

16
00:04:16,988 --> 00:04:19,889
Here, take these.
They'll keep your feet dry.

17
00:04:21,325 --> 00:04:25,193
If you make it out alive, give me a call.
My number's inside the boots.

18
00:04:25,530 --> 00:04:26,690
Thanks.

19
00:09:04,542 --> 00:09:05,668
Hello?

20
00:10:11,342 --> 00:10:14,903
Is there anybody here?

21
00:10:17,815 --> 00:10:19,282
Guess not!

22
00:11:27,918 --> 00:11:30,079
Two years he walks the earth.

23
00:11:37,328 --> 00:11:39,660
No phone, no pool, no pets,

24
00:11:40,831 --> 00:11:42,298
no cigarettes.

25
00:11:59,750 --> 00:12:01,411
Ultimate freedom.

26
00:12:03,387 --> 00:12:07,346
An extremist. An aesthetic voyager

27
00:12:09,193 --> 00:12:13,323
whose home is the road.

28
00:12:14,298 --> 00:12:17,665
"Hey, listen, old man.
Now, don't psychoanalyze me, all right?

29
00:12:18,035 --> 00:12:20,663
"Shut up.
I'm taking you out to where we're going."

30
00:12:20,771 --> 00:12:22,329
"Where you going?"

31
00:12:22,539 --> 00:12:25,133
"I told you. We're going nowhere!"

32
00:12:27,745 --> 00:12:33,342
So now, after two rambling years
comes the final and greatest adventure.

33
00:12:34,952 --> 00:12:38,183
The climactic battle to kill

34
00:12:39,623 --> 00:12:41,488
the false being within

35
00:12:42,693 --> 00:12:46,561
and victoriously conclude
the spiritual revolution.

36
00:13:16,260 --> 00:13:20,856
No longer to be poisoned
by civilization, he flees,

37
00:13:21,765 --> 00:13:24,495
and walks alone
upon the land to become

38
00:13:25,936 --> 00:13:27,494
lost in the wild.

39
00:13:59,069 --> 00:14:04,097
Hard work and manifold contributions
to our community during their time here,

40
00:14:05,075 --> 00:14:08,374
we salute you and offer all of you

41
00:14:08,545 --> 00:14:11,605
one more round of applause
and congratulations.

42
00:14:18,422 --> 00:14:21,186
Nina Lynn Lockwynn.

43
00:14:26,130 --> 00:14:29,327
Vanessa Denise Lowery.

44
00:14:33,737 --> 00:14:37,173
Christopher Johnson McCandless.

45
00:14:48,352 --> 00:14:51,549
Regina Victoria McNabb.

46
00:15:14,745 --> 00:15:18,340
I see them standing at the formal gates
of their colleges.

47
00:15:21,585 --> 00:15:25,578
I see my father strolling out
under the ochre sandstone arch,

48
00:15:26,023 --> 00:15:30,119
the red tiles glinting like bent plates
of blood behind his head.

49
00:15:31,128 --> 00:15:33,858
I see my mother
with a few light books at her hip,

50
00:15:33,964 --> 00:15:37,559
standing at the pillar made of tiny
bricks with the wrought-iron gates

51
00:15:37,668 --> 00:15:41,729
still open behind her,
its sword-tips black in the May air.

52
00:15:42,739 --> 00:15:44,798
They are about to graduate.

53
00:15:46,043 --> 00:15:50,776
They are about to get married.
They are kids. They are dumb.

54
00:15:51,381 --> 00:15:55,408
All they know is they are innocent,
they would never hurt anybody.

55
00:15:57,688 --> 00:16:01,351
I want to go up to them and say,
"Stop, don't do it.

56
00:16:01,658 --> 00:16:05,185
"She's the wrong woman,
he's the wrong man.

57
00:16:05,529 --> 00:16:09,556
"You are going to do things
you cannot imagine you would ever do.

58
00:16:09,766 --> 00:16:12,826
"You are going to do bad things
to children.

59
00:16:12,936 --> 00:16:15,496
"You are going to suffer
in ways you never heard of.

60
00:16:15,606 --> 00:16:17,574
"You are going to want to die."

61
00:16:20,077 --> 00:16:24,104
I want to go up to them there
in the late May sunlight and say it.

62
00:16:24,548 --> 00:16:27,483
But I don't do it. I want to live.

63
00:16:29,519 --> 00:16:33,546
I take them up like the male and female
paper dolls, and bang them together

64
00:16:33,657 --> 00:16:38,617
at the hips like chips of flint, as if
to strike sparks from them. I say,

65
00:16:40,163 --> 00:16:44,657
"Do what you are going to do
and I will tell about it."

66
00:16:45,969 --> 00:16:48,403
Here they are, Walt. Okay?

67
00:16:49,373 --> 00:16:51,034
Who wrote that?

68
00:16:51,575 --> 00:16:56,069
Well, could have been either one of us,
couldn't it?

69
00:16:56,179 --> 00:16:58,841
Why is he letting Carine drive his car?

70
00:16:59,683 --> 00:17:02,243
There's a lot of great poems in here.

71
00:17:07,157 --> 00:17:09,352
I have to speak to her about it.

72
00:17:09,459 --> 00:17:10,448
Sit down.

73
00:17:11,428 --> 00:17:13,225
Excuse me. I'm going to get my son.

74
00:17:13,330 --> 00:17:16,493
He just graduated today
from Emory College.

75
00:17:16,600 --> 00:17:17,862
I'll get it. I'll get it.

76
00:17:17,968 --> 00:17:21,529
Chris, hi!
We've been waiting and waiting.

77
00:17:21,638 --> 00:17:26,007
You scared me half to death
jumping up there on that stage like that.

78
00:17:27,277 --> 00:17:29,472
- Hi, Dad.
- Congratulations, Son.

79
00:17:29,646 --> 00:17:32,979
- This is a big step.
- Thank you, Dad.

80
00:17:33,550 --> 00:17:34,847
All right.

81
00:17:36,119 --> 00:17:37,988
You're not supposed to be driving
in Georgia.

82
00:17:38,221 --> 00:17:39,313
Why? I have my permit.

83
00:17:39,423 --> 00:17:41,618
'Cause it's against the law
for a learner's permit

84
00:17:41,725 --> 00:17:45,092
to drive in another state
from one's home state. That's why.

85
00:17:45,195 --> 00:17:48,596
I didn't know that. I thought that if I was
with a legal driver that it'd be okay.

86
00:17:48,699 --> 00:17:49,666
Well, let's...

87
00:17:59,376 --> 00:18:02,402
- Are they going to continue?
- No.

88
00:18:04,748 --> 00:18:07,342
I guess everybody's celebrating today.

89
00:18:07,617 --> 00:18:11,417
- They're going to stay in the bar, right?
- That's right.

90
00:18:22,833 --> 00:18:26,462
My grades are good enough, I think,
to get into Harvard Law.

91
00:18:26,570 --> 00:18:28,504
Chris, that's wonderful.

92
00:18:30,007 --> 00:18:32,032
That is a big deal.

93
00:18:32,776 --> 00:18:35,438
How much do you have left
in the college fund?

94
00:18:35,912 --> 00:18:41,009
Exactly $24,500.68.

95
00:18:41,118 --> 00:18:42,745
Well, that's specific.

96
00:18:42,853 --> 00:18:45,583
I had to go to the bank
this morning, Mom.

97
00:18:47,257 --> 00:18:51,421
Your mother and I will be glad
to contribute the balance for Harvard.

98
00:18:51,528 --> 00:18:52,961
That's right.

99
00:18:53,296 --> 00:18:54,593
I've got to figure out
what I'm going to do.

100
00:18:54,698 --> 00:18:58,134
I've got a lot of things
to pack and organize here first.

101
00:18:58,235 --> 00:19:02,695
Your father and I,
we want to make a present to you.

102
00:19:03,540 --> 00:19:06,134
We want to get you out of that junker.

103
00:19:06,710 --> 00:19:08,075
What junker?

104
00:19:08,578 --> 00:19:09,806
That.

105
00:19:12,249 --> 00:19:15,548
- We want to buy you a new car.
- That's right.

106
00:19:15,719 --> 00:19:17,118
A new car?

107
00:19:19,389 --> 00:19:21,448
Why would I want a new car?

108
00:19:22,559 --> 00:19:24,220
Datsun runs great.

109
00:19:25,796 --> 00:19:28,560
Do you think I want some fancy boat?

110
00:19:30,434 --> 00:19:33,460
Are you worried
what the neighbors might think?

111
00:19:33,637 --> 00:19:36,435
Well, we weren't gonna get you
a brand new Cadillac, Chris.

112
00:19:36,540 --> 00:19:39,737
We just want to get you a nice new car
that's safe to drive.

113
00:19:39,843 --> 00:19:43,370
And you never know when that thing
out there just might blow up.

114
00:19:43,480 --> 00:19:49,680
Blow up. Blow up?
Are you guys crazy? It's a great car.

115
00:19:50,253 --> 00:19:54,451
I don't need a new car.
I don't want a new car.

116
00:19:54,858 --> 00:19:56,917
- I don't want anything.
- Okay.

117
00:19:57,027 --> 00:20:00,758
- These things, things, things, things.
- Okay.

118
00:20:00,864 --> 00:20:02,665
- Everything has to be difficult.
- Thank you.

119
00:20:02,732 --> 00:20:04,791
- Thank you.
- Maybe that's not what he means.

120
00:20:04,901 --> 00:20:08,530
Maybe he just wants his old car.
It's not such a big deal.

121
00:20:10,874 --> 00:20:13,468
Thank you. I just don't want anything.

122
00:20:22,919 --> 00:20:25,285
Chris measured himself
and those around him

123
00:20:25,388 --> 00:20:27,913
by a fiercely rigorous moral code.

124
00:20:28,058 --> 00:20:29,116
Bye, Chris!

125
00:20:29,493 --> 00:20:32,553
He risked what could have been
a relentlessly lonely path

126
00:20:32,662 --> 00:20:36,359
but found company
in the characters of the books he loved

127
00:20:39,002 --> 00:20:43,200
from writers like Tolstoy,
Jack London and Thoreau.

128
00:20:44,875 --> 00:20:48,003
He could summon their words
to suit any occasion,

129
00:20:48,845 --> 00:20:50,540
and he often would.

130
00:21:05,962 --> 00:21:10,956
I forgot to ask what quote he'd have
picked for his graduation dinner,

131
00:21:11,067 --> 00:21:14,628
but I had a good idea
of who the primary target would be.

132
00:21:19,509 --> 00:21:22,478
It was inevitable
that Chris would break away.

133
00:21:24,548 --> 00:21:29,144
And when he did, he would do it
with characteristic immoderation.

134
00:22:14,631 --> 00:22:18,965
"It should not be denied that being
footloose has always exhilarated us.

135
00:22:20,003 --> 00:22:22,870
"It is associated in our minds
with escape

136
00:22:24,074 --> 00:22:27,874
"from history and oppression and law
and irksome obligations.

137
00:22:29,412 --> 00:22:31,107
"Absolute freedom.

138
00:22:33,416 --> 00:22:35,782
"And the road has always led west."

139
00:24:36,072 --> 00:24:37,539
I need a name.

140
00:25:06,936 --> 00:25:08,801
Toward the end of June,

141
00:25:08,905 --> 00:25:11,897
Emory had mailed our parents
Chris' final grade report.

142
00:25:12,509 --> 00:25:14,067
Almost all A's.

143
00:25:14,544 --> 00:25:17,240
A in Apartheid in South African Society.

144
00:25:18,081 --> 00:25:22,575
A- minus in Contemporary African
Politics and the Food Crisis in Africa.

145
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:26,853
And on it went. Clever boy, my brother.

146
00:25:28,491 --> 00:25:32,154
But by the end of July,
we hadn't heard anything from him

147
00:25:32,262 --> 00:25:34,753
and my parents
were becoming unsettled.

148
00:25:36,399 --> 00:25:38,731
Chris had never had a phone,

149
00:25:38,835 --> 00:25:42,327
so they decided to drive down
to Atlanta and surprise him.

150
00:25:57,454 --> 00:26:00,184
When they arrived at the apartment,
there was a "For Rent" sign up

151
00:26:00,290 --> 00:26:03,748
and the manager said that Chris
had moved out at the end of May.

152
00:26:03,860 --> 00:26:05,885
Oh, yes. He left two months ago.

153
00:26:06,196 --> 00:26:08,187
So when they got home,

154
00:26:08,298 --> 00:26:12,394
I had to hand them all the letters that
they had sent Chris that summer,

155
00:26:13,002 --> 00:26:16,802
which had been returned in a bundle.

156
00:26:17,240 --> 00:26:21,404
Chris had arranged for the post office
to hold them until August 1st,

157
00:26:21,511 --> 00:26:24,378
to buy himself some time.

158
00:26:25,448 --> 00:26:27,439
Did you know about this?

159
00:26:28,084 --> 00:26:29,949
He didn't say anything.

160
00:26:30,620 --> 00:26:34,147
I understood what he was doing.
That he had spent four years

161
00:26:34,257 --> 00:26:38,284
fulfilling the absurd and tedious duty
of graduating from college,

162
00:26:40,964 --> 00:26:45,401
and now he was emancipated
from that world of abstraction,

163
00:26:45,502 --> 00:26:49,996
false security, parents
and material excess,

164
00:26:51,040 --> 00:26:54,840
the things that cut Chris off
from the truth of his existence.

165
00:28:09,185 --> 00:28:10,311
Hey!

166
00:28:14,357 --> 00:28:17,190
- Hey, man. Step around. Jump in.
- Okay, great.

167
00:28:17,794 --> 00:28:21,025
We barely saw you there
underneath that crazy hat of yours.

168
00:28:21,197 --> 00:28:24,860
This door's a little tricky.
There you go. Hop in.

169
00:28:28,504 --> 00:28:29,698
That's Rainey.

170
00:28:29,806 --> 00:28:31,501
- Hi, Rainey.
- Yeah, I'm Rainey.

171
00:28:31,608 --> 00:28:33,235
- I'm Jan.
- Hi. I'm Alex.

172
00:28:33,343 --> 00:28:34,674
Alex with the hat on.

173
00:28:34,777 --> 00:28:36,836
- Yeah, I know. You said it, man.
- Yeah.

174
00:28:38,615 --> 00:28:40,549
So you're a leather now.

175
00:28:41,818 --> 00:28:42,876
I'm a leather?

176
00:28:42,986 --> 00:28:48,083
Yeah, a leather tramp. That's what they
call the ones that hoof it, go on foot.

177
00:28:48,958 --> 00:28:51,153
Technically we're rubber tramps.

178
00:28:51,260 --> 00:28:53,251
Because we have a vehicle.

179
00:28:54,464 --> 00:28:57,729
- You don't have to push me away.
- Come on, please?

180
00:28:59,268 --> 00:29:04,365
Yeah, Alex could have a vehicle as well,
but he decided to burn all of his money.

181
00:29:06,676 --> 00:29:08,610
And why did you do that?

182
00:29:10,380 --> 00:29:13,679
I don't need money.
Makes people cautious.

183
00:29:16,085 --> 00:29:18,610
Come on, Alex.
You gotta be a little cautious.

184
00:29:18,721 --> 00:29:21,781
I mean, that book of yours is cool
and everything,

185
00:29:22,091 --> 00:29:25,151
but you can't depend entirely
on leaves and berries.

186
00:29:26,329 --> 00:29:29,924
I don't know if you want to depend on
much more than that.

187
00:29:30,833 --> 00:29:32,892
Where are your mom and dad?

188
00:29:35,938 --> 00:29:38,099
Living their lies somewhere.

189
00:29:41,144 --> 00:29:43,635
You look like a loved kid. Be fair.

190
00:29:44,847 --> 00:29:45,905
Fair?

191
00:29:46,949 --> 00:29:48,712
You know what I mean.

192
00:29:51,821 --> 00:29:54,016
I'll paraphrase Thoreau here.

193
00:29:55,058 --> 00:29:59,324
"Rather than love, than money,
than faith,

194
00:29:59,462 --> 00:30:03,455
"than fame, than fairness,

195
00:30:05,902 --> 00:30:07,460
"give me truth."

196
00:30:28,925 --> 00:30:31,951
From as long ago
as Chris and I could remember,

197
00:30:32,128 --> 00:30:35,291
there have been
daily bouts of rage in our house.

198
00:30:35,398 --> 00:30:39,858
Violence that we were forced
to witness. It was very real.

199
00:30:41,804 --> 00:30:44,364
But it was also like theater.

200
00:30:45,908 --> 00:30:49,844
They cast us as both judges
and the accused.

201
00:30:50,213 --> 00:30:55,810
And I got you this token,
this expensive token.

202
00:30:56,252 --> 00:30:58,379
Dad had been the young genius

203
00:30:58,488 --> 00:31:03,289
that NASA enlisted to do crucial designs
for the American satellite radar systems

204
00:31:03,392 --> 00:31:07,886
that would be our answer
to the Russian Sputnik.

205
00:31:07,997 --> 00:31:10,431
And Mom and he later started up
a consulting firm

206
00:31:10,533 --> 00:31:13,969
combining her
get-up-and-go resourcefulness

207
00:31:14,070 --> 00:31:15,662
with his wealth of knowledge.

208
00:31:15,772 --> 00:31:17,933
Look at this.

209
00:31:21,010 --> 00:31:24,707
But by the time the company
actually made its first million,

210
00:31:25,081 --> 00:31:29,814
the careerism and money seemed
only to embolden their blindness.

211
00:31:30,486 --> 00:31:32,454
Thank you very, very much.

212
00:31:33,523 --> 00:31:36,048
I remember the first family meeting

213
00:31:36,425 --> 00:31:39,826
to let us in on their plans
for getting a divorce.

214
00:31:40,630 --> 00:31:44,031
They wanted us to choose
which of them we'd live with.

215
00:31:46,035 --> 00:31:47,866
We cried our eyes out.

216
00:31:50,139 --> 00:31:52,300
The divorce never happened,

217
00:31:53,075 --> 00:31:56,169
but the battles and the meetings
never stopped.

218
00:31:57,480 --> 00:32:00,540
It wasn't very long
before Chris and I shut off.

219
00:32:02,451 --> 00:32:05,181
We'd say "Go ahead.

220
00:32:06,823 --> 00:32:08,450
"Get the divorce."

221
00:32:09,926 --> 00:32:14,795
Jeez. If I struck a match to you I'd have
dinner and warmth at the same time.

222
00:32:15,898 --> 00:32:17,525
Where's Jan going?

223
00:32:20,102 --> 00:32:21,660
Well, my friend,

224
00:32:23,239 --> 00:32:25,730
all is not well on the hippie front.

225
00:32:35,451 --> 00:32:38,545
You're an industrious little fucker,
aren't you?

226
00:32:39,822 --> 00:32:41,153
Little bit.

227
00:32:46,162 --> 00:32:50,531
It's funny how things happen
at particular times.

228
00:32:52,535 --> 00:32:55,971
I've loved that woman
for a lot of years, bro.

229
00:32:58,975 --> 00:33:01,603
But, you know, she's got a story.

230
00:33:02,545 --> 00:33:06,743
We've been going through this thing,
real quiet.

231
00:33:09,418 --> 00:33:13,479
So when we ran into you yesterday,

232
00:33:13,990 --> 00:33:17,255
this thing that we've been going
through real quiet,

233
00:33:18,361 --> 00:33:21,262
she's talking about it.
You know what I mean?

234
00:33:21,797 --> 00:33:24,698
- I think I do.
- You think what?

235
00:33:27,637 --> 00:33:28,604
Well...

236
00:33:31,741 --> 00:33:35,643
Some people feel like
they don't deserve love.

237
00:33:36,045 --> 00:33:40,414
They walk away quietly
into empty spaces,

238
00:33:42,084 --> 00:33:45,144
trying to close the gaps to the past.

239
00:33:45,321 --> 00:33:48,381
That's a hell of an insight. Jesus!

240
00:33:51,394 --> 00:33:54,363
- You're not Jesus, are you?
- Look who's talking.

241
00:33:54,463 --> 00:33:59,127
You gonna walk across the water
and get her back for me, pal?

242
00:33:59,936 --> 00:34:03,599
No. I'm afraid of water.

243
00:34:04,273 --> 00:34:05,865
Always have been.

244
00:34:06,175 --> 00:34:12,011
Something I've gotta get over sometime
though, huh? So I will swim in it

245
00:34:12,348 --> 00:34:15,146
if you'll carry the firewood back to camp.

246
00:34:17,486 --> 00:34:19,078
- Shit, yeah.
- Yeah?

247
00:34:19,188 --> 00:34:21,679
- Call it carried.
- All right.

248
00:34:56,459 --> 00:34:59,189
"The sea's only gifts are harsh blows,

249
00:35:02,965 --> 00:35:05,866
"and, occasionally,
the chance to feel strong.

250
00:35:06,602 --> 00:35:10,231
"Now, I don't know much about the sea,

251
00:35:10,873 --> 00:35:13,899
"but I do know that
that's the way it is here.

252
00:35:15,478 --> 00:35:17,946
"And I also know
how important it is in life

253
00:35:18,047 --> 00:35:22,074
"not necessarily to be strong,
but to feel strong,

254
00:35:23,319 --> 00:35:25,810
"to measure yourself at least once,

255
00:35:27,490 --> 00:35:31,927
"to find yourself at least once in
the most ancient of human conditions,

256
00:35:33,596 --> 00:35:36,156
"facing the blind, deaf stone alone

257
00:35:36,799 --> 00:35:40,895
"with nothing to help you
but your hands and your own head."

258
00:35:46,142 --> 00:35:48,372
There's a big wave coming!

259
00:35:52,181 --> 00:35:54,706
Rainey, I'm freezing!

260
00:35:55,317 --> 00:35:59,481
Could you put your arms around me?

261
00:36:21,510 --> 00:36:26,106
The Navy bulldozed and abandoned this
base down there,

262
00:36:26,215 --> 00:36:33,178
and all that's left is this huge grid
of concrete foundations, or slabs.

263
00:36:33,889 --> 00:36:37,689
- Man, you would dig the Slabs.
- You would like it. You would like it.

264
00:36:37,793 --> 00:36:39,988
- If you're on the road still.
- You'd love it.

265
00:36:40,096 --> 00:36:41,529
Fellow travelers.

266
00:36:41,630 --> 00:36:44,224
Just living on the cheap under the sun.
Can't beat it.

267
00:36:44,333 --> 00:36:45,698
Sounds good.

268
00:36:45,935 --> 00:36:48,529
If you come, I'll make you a proper hat.

269
00:36:48,637 --> 00:36:51,731
- Promise?
- I swear to God.

270
00:36:59,482 --> 00:37:02,246
Oh, baby. Baby.

271
00:37:02,718 --> 00:37:05,152
- Stop it. Wait.
- Yeah.

272
00:37:07,857 --> 00:37:10,291
- Oh, yes.
- Okay.

273
00:37:11,927 --> 00:37:13,622
Let me turn off the light.

274
00:37:55,504 --> 00:37:59,565
- He reminded me of...
- I know.

275
00:38:08,417 --> 00:38:11,545
Such is the way of the world

276
00:38:11,687 --> 00:38:14,087
You can never know

277
00:38:16,992 --> 00:38:22,862
Just where to put all your faith
And how will it grow?

278
00:38:24,667 --> 00:38:27,329
Gonna rise up

279
00:38:27,436 --> 00:38:32,032
Burning back holes in dark memories

280
00:38:32,841 --> 00:38:35,435
Gonna rise up

281
00:38:35,544 --> 00:38:39,878
Turning mistakes into gold

282
00:38:39,982 --> 00:38:43,611
I mean, you're really good.
I mean, you're like

283
00:38:44,887 --> 00:38:49,756
100,000 times better than, like,
any apple I've ever had.

284
00:38:51,594 --> 00:38:53,960
I'm not Superman, I'm Supertramp.

285
00:38:56,165 --> 00:38:58,030
You're Superapple.

286
00:38:58,133 --> 00:39:04,834
You're so tasty.
You're so organic, so natural.

287
00:39:06,041 --> 00:39:08,134
You're the apple of my eye.

288
00:39:10,512 --> 00:39:17,008
Hey! Such is the passage of time
Too fast to fold

289
00:39:18,754 --> 00:39:24,852
And suddenly swallowed by signs
Lo and behold

290
00:39:26,195 --> 00:39:28,993
Gonna rise up

291
00:39:29,098 --> 00:39:33,660
Find my direction magnetically

292
00:39:34,336 --> 00:39:36,930
Gonna rise up

293
00:39:37,039 --> 00:39:41,476
Throw down my ace in the hole

294
00:39:43,712 --> 00:39:48,115
In early September, Mom and Dad
got a call from the Annandale police

295
00:39:48,217 --> 00:39:50,242
notifying them that
Chris' abandoned car

296
00:39:50,352 --> 00:39:53,753
had been identified
by the Arizona Highway Patrol.

297
00:39:54,256 --> 00:39:58,420
A group of rare flower hunters
stumbled upon it in the desert.

298
00:39:59,795 --> 00:40:03,322
There were no signs that
Chris had intended to return to it.

299
00:40:03,432 --> 00:40:06,560
But there wasn't
any evidence of struggle, either.

300
00:40:08,504 --> 00:40:10,904
The police thought
Chris had chosen to leave it behind

301
00:40:11,006 --> 00:40:13,668
and not that it was taken from him.

302
00:40:17,279 --> 00:40:22,216
The initial comfort
that gave Mom and Dad quickly turned

303
00:40:22,318 --> 00:40:27,051
to the realization that Chris
was actually trying not to be found.

304
00:41:08,197 --> 00:41:09,562
Strong.

305
00:41:10,866 --> 00:41:15,200
You can do anything.
You can go anywhere.

306
00:41:15,971 --> 00:41:22,001
Money, power is an illusion.
It's up here.

307
00:41:23,545 --> 00:41:25,103
You can be here.

308
00:41:26,382 --> 00:41:28,873
Me and you.

309
00:41:43,365 --> 00:41:47,893
One, two. No, no, no.

310
00:41:55,644 --> 00:41:57,111
Two,

311
00:42:01,817 --> 00:42:02,943
three...

312
00:42:53,969 --> 00:42:56,301
Don't be shy with it. Get it moving there.
That's good.

313
00:42:56,972 --> 00:42:58,633
- That's your speed right here.
- Right.

314
00:42:59,741 --> 00:43:01,675
You go too fast,
you won't get all the wheat.

315
00:43:02,010 --> 00:43:04,808
That's it, straight line, straight line,
little straighter.

316
00:43:04,913 --> 00:43:08,212
See how you're bearing? Just a little
straighter. Now you're a combiner.

317
00:43:08,317 --> 00:43:10,376
Wow, look at this view!

318
00:43:10,486 --> 00:43:13,148
But keep your eye on the wheat, here.
Make sure you're cutting it.

319
00:43:13,255 --> 00:43:16,418
You can look back here and see
how much is coming out, all right.

320
00:43:16,525 --> 00:43:18,152
- How do you feel?
- I feel great.

321
00:43:18,260 --> 00:43:21,286
Okay, keep it straight. God bless you.

322
00:43:21,396 --> 00:43:23,694
Make yourself some money, my friend.
I'll see you in a little bit.

323
00:43:23,799 --> 00:43:24,823
Okay.

324
00:43:31,607 --> 00:43:35,407
Wayne. Where you going?

325
00:43:54,263 --> 00:43:58,597
Kevin, you know I love you.
I'm joking with you. I'm joking. Stop it.

326
00:43:58,734 --> 00:44:01,999
- I'm joking with you.
- Mind your own business, Wayne!

327
00:44:02,104 --> 00:44:04,265
- What are you getting so hostile for?
- I don't know.

328
00:44:04,373 --> 00:44:06,671
Me and you are on the same side.
We're on the same side.

329
00:44:06,775 --> 00:44:09,835
- I'm just tired of the teasing a lot.
- Kevin, we're on the same side.

330
00:44:09,945 --> 00:44:14,575
Let me get some...
If I want some vagina, let me get it.

331
00:44:14,683 --> 00:44:17,174
- Whoa. He's serious about this.
- Let's just play cards.

332
00:44:17,286 --> 00:44:18,844
- Can we just play cards?
- Let's go, then.

333
00:44:18,954 --> 00:44:21,684
$2, $4, $6, just put all the money in.

334
00:44:21,790 --> 00:44:23,621
I just wanna see
everybody going for broke.

335
00:44:23,725 --> 00:44:26,285
- You want to play?
- No.

336
00:44:41,243 --> 00:44:43,040
- Kevin, what have you got for the week?
- I got 260.

337
00:44:43,145 --> 00:44:44,840
We're at 260.

338
00:44:51,320 --> 00:44:53,240
We're gonna stay right at 260,
that's our number.

339
00:44:53,288 --> 00:44:55,119
We've got 20,000 pounds.

340
00:44:55,223 --> 00:44:59,057
We've got 20,000 pounds
we need to get rid of.

341
00:45:01,964 --> 00:45:05,923
Maybe just do all that after lunch
before we get back into everything else.

342
00:45:06,034 --> 00:45:09,470
Can we do the $500 reserves...

343
00:45:18,413 --> 00:45:20,904
What do you think about all this?

344
00:45:21,783 --> 00:45:23,341
I like all this.

345
00:45:35,464 --> 00:45:37,796
I don't think he can do it.

346
00:45:40,969 --> 00:45:43,028
Is there a library
or bookstore around here

347
00:45:43,138 --> 00:45:45,197
where I can get books
on hunting and preserving?

348
00:45:45,307 --> 00:45:47,298
Anything at all to do with hunting
or preserving the meat,

349
00:45:47,409 --> 00:45:49,434
smoking it, whatever the hell it is,

350
00:45:49,544 --> 00:45:52,411
talk to Kevin over there.
That's your man.

351
00:45:52,781 --> 00:45:55,944
Outdoorsman. What's your fascination
with all that stuff?

352
00:45:56,051 --> 00:45:57,643
I'm going to Alaska.

353
00:45:58,020 --> 00:46:00,921
Alaska, Alaska? Or city Alaska?

354
00:46:01,023 --> 00:46:03,548
Because they do have markets
in Alaska.

355
00:46:03,659 --> 00:46:06,822
The city of Alaska. Not in Alaska.
In the city of Alaska, they have markets.

356
00:46:06,928 --> 00:46:10,159
No, man. Alaska, Alaska.

357
00:46:10,732 --> 00:46:14,498
I'm gonna be all the way out there,
all the way fucking out there.

358
00:46:15,237 --> 00:46:16,431
Just on my own.

359
00:46:16,538 --> 00:46:22,033
You know, no fucking watch,
no map, no ax, no nothing. No nothing.

360
00:46:22,144 --> 00:46:24,806
Just be out there. Just be out there in it.

361
00:46:24,913 --> 00:46:29,282
You know, big mountains, rivers,
sky, game.

362
00:46:29,384 --> 00:46:33,252
Just be out there in it, you know?
In the wild.

363
00:46:33,422 --> 00:46:35,322
- In the wild.
- Just wild.

364
00:46:35,424 --> 00:46:37,415
- Yeah.
- Just...

365
00:46:37,559 --> 00:46:38,583
What are you doing when we're there?

366
00:46:38,694 --> 00:46:40,889
Now you're in the wild,
what are we doing?

367
00:46:40,996 --> 00:46:42,122
You're just living, man.

368
00:46:42,230 --> 00:46:45,631
You're just there, in that moment,
in that special place and time.

369
00:46:45,734 --> 00:46:46,928
Yeah.

370
00:46:47,069 --> 00:46:49,594
Maybe when I get back,
I can write a book about my travels.

371
00:46:49,705 --> 00:46:50,694
Why not?

372
00:46:50,806 --> 00:46:52,865
You know,
about getting out of this sick society.

373
00:46:52,974 --> 00:46:55,738
- Society!
- Society!

374
00:46:55,844 --> 00:46:57,402
- Society, man!
- Society!

375
00:46:57,512 --> 00:46:59,707
- Society! Society!
- Society!

376
00:46:59,815 --> 00:47:02,511
Society, you know! Society!

377
00:47:03,351 --> 00:47:05,979
'Cause you know
what I don't understand?

378
00:47:06,088 --> 00:47:10,047
I don't understand why people,
why every fucking person

379
00:47:10,158 --> 00:47:13,491
is so bad to each other so fucking often.

380
00:47:13,595 --> 00:47:18,726
It doesn't make sense to me. Judgment.
Control. All that, the whole spectrum.

381
00:47:18,834 --> 00:47:22,600
- Well, it just...
- What "people" we talking about?

382
00:47:24,272 --> 00:47:28,971
You know, parents, hypocrites,

383
00:47:29,878 --> 00:47:33,314
politicians, pricks.

384
00:47:34,950 --> 00:47:37,384
This is a mistake.

385
00:47:37,486 --> 00:47:41,149
It's a mistake to get too deep
into all that kind of stuff.

386
00:47:43,859 --> 00:47:47,056
Alex, you're a hell of a young guy,
a hell of a young guy.

387
00:47:48,697 --> 00:47:50,562
But I promise you this.

388
00:47:51,800 --> 00:47:56,362
You're a young guy! Can't be juggling
blood and fire all the time!

389
00:47:56,838 --> 00:48:00,069
- You've got to just kind of...
- Wayne, what are you talking about?

390
00:48:00,175 --> 00:48:01,574
- What?
- I mean...

391
00:48:01,676 --> 00:48:02,997
I'm talking about blood and fire.

392
00:48:03,044 --> 00:48:05,084
We're talking about
trying to juggle blood and fire.

393
00:48:05,180 --> 00:48:06,875
Who are you to be giving advice
to anybody anyway?

394
00:48:06,982 --> 00:48:08,543
Who am I to be giving advice
to anybody?

395
00:48:08,650 --> 00:48:10,277
- Yes.
- Well, it's nice to meet you.

396
00:48:10,385 --> 00:48:12,148
- My name is Mr. Happy.
- Mr. Happy.

397
00:48:12,254 --> 00:48:14,484
And Mr. Happy sometimes gives advice.

398
00:48:14,589 --> 00:48:16,614
- Alex, please.
- I'm sorry.

399
00:48:16,725 --> 00:48:19,319
Sometimes Mr. Happy...
Well, Mr. Happy is always happy.

400
00:48:19,427 --> 00:48:20,860
But you know when he's happiest?

401
00:48:20,962 --> 00:48:22,327
- He's not always happy.
- When is he happy?

402
00:48:22,430 --> 00:48:24,955
Are you really gonna say that to me?
Come on, tell me about it.

403
00:48:25,066 --> 00:48:26,966
I am going to say that to you.

404
00:48:31,907 --> 00:48:34,375
- Now...
- Sit down before you hurt yourself.

405
00:48:34,476 --> 00:48:37,639
One thing that you should try
to keep your eye on

406
00:48:38,346 --> 00:48:41,372
is what happened
in the late 1940s in Roswell.

407
00:48:55,363 --> 00:48:57,558
When a search of tax records
revealed that

408
00:48:57,666 --> 00:49:00,191
Chris had given
his life savings to charity,

409
00:49:00,602 --> 00:49:04,902
Mom and Dad became
what Dad called "mobilized."

410
00:49:05,006 --> 00:49:09,466
They hired a private investigator and
notified law enforcement nationwide,

411
00:49:09,811 --> 00:49:12,143
determined to track him down.

412
00:49:12,480 --> 00:49:17,008
I just figured he'd be with gypsies,
far from the eyes of the law.

413
00:49:21,156 --> 00:49:23,488
These are those free satellite TV deals.

414
00:49:23,592 --> 00:49:26,493
You're the one who said it, Alex, not me.

415
00:49:28,763 --> 00:49:31,197
You're gonna need something.
What kind of gun you got?

416
00:49:31,299 --> 00:49:35,565
I'm probably gonna get like a.22,
I think. A.22 caliber rifle.

417
00:49:37,839 --> 00:49:39,238
All right, then.

418
00:49:39,741 --> 00:49:42,505
When you get your kill,
time is of the essence.

419
00:49:42,611 --> 00:49:44,670
Now, the first thing you wanna do
is make sure

420
00:49:44,779 --> 00:49:47,771
that you got that meat
nice and shaved up.

421
00:49:47,949 --> 00:49:50,440
And you don't have a lot of time to do
this. This is about an hour or two.

422
00:49:50,552 --> 00:49:54,454
Depending on the weather. Especially if
it's hot, you've got less time to do it.

423
00:49:54,556 --> 00:49:58,720
What you do is you want to make sure
that them flies don't land on your meat.

424
00:49:58,827 --> 00:50:02,627
Because once them flies start
shitting out larvae and them maggots,

425
00:50:03,365 --> 00:50:07,392
you know, those creepy crawlies,
it's too late. It's too late.

426
00:51:14,903 --> 00:51:17,269
You got me. You got me.

427
00:51:23,111 --> 00:51:25,636
I warned Wayne
about them little black boxes.

428
00:51:25,847 --> 00:51:29,442
Mr. Westerberg, Scott Baker, FBI.
I think you know why we're here.

429
00:51:29,551 --> 00:51:31,712
- Impressive turn-out.
- Yeah.

430
00:51:31,820 --> 00:51:34,880
You mind grabbing that zipper
for me there? Thank you.

431
00:51:35,657 --> 00:51:36,715
- Let's go.
- Sorry, boys.

432
00:51:36,825 --> 00:51:39,055
We're gonna have to shut down
for a little while.

433
00:51:39,160 --> 00:51:41,890
Alex, you come back
and work for me any time you want.

434
00:51:41,997 --> 00:51:44,666
Gil's got your checks, guys.
I shouldn't be away too long.

435
00:51:44,799 --> 00:51:49,634
Remember Alex, no Alaska till spring.
South, kid. You wanna head south.

436
00:52:15,230 --> 00:52:17,596
The year Chris graduated high school,

437
00:52:17,699 --> 00:52:21,066
he bought the Datsun used
and drove it cross-country.

438
00:52:22,437 --> 00:52:24,564
He stayed away most of the summer.

439
00:52:25,206 --> 00:52:27,674
Come on. The neighbors
are gonna be watching, honey.

440
00:52:27,776 --> 00:52:29,107
Can you spray it?

441
00:52:34,482 --> 00:52:38,578
As soon as I heard he was home,
I ran into his room to talk to him.

442
00:52:43,425 --> 00:52:46,986
In California,
he'd looked up some old family friends.

443
00:52:47,796 --> 00:52:52,631
He discovered that our parents' stories
of how they fell in love and got married

444
00:52:52,734 --> 00:52:55,567
were calculated lies
masking an ugly truth.

445
00:52:56,805 --> 00:52:59,467
When they met,
Dad was already married.

446
00:53:00,475 --> 00:53:02,739
And even after Chris was born,

447
00:53:02,844 --> 00:53:05,677
Dad had had another son
with his first wife, Marcia,

448
00:53:07,048 --> 00:53:09,642
to whom he was still legally married.

449
00:53:11,619 --> 00:53:16,818
This fact suddenly re-defined
Chris and me as bastard children.

450
00:53:21,463 --> 00:53:26,196
Dad's arrogance made him conveniently
oblivious to the pain he caused.

451
00:53:27,936 --> 00:53:31,997
And Mom, in the shame and
embarrassment of a young mistress,

452
00:53:32,640 --> 00:53:35,108
became his accomplice in deceit.

453
00:53:40,582 --> 00:53:44,279
The fragility of crystal is not
a weakness but a fineness.

454
00:53:45,487 --> 00:53:48,615
My parents understood that
a fine crystal glass had to be cared for

455
00:53:48,723 --> 00:53:51,123
or it may be shattered.

456
00:53:51,226 --> 00:53:55,458
But when it came to my brother,
they did not seem to know or care

457
00:53:55,563 --> 00:53:57,793
that their course of secret action

458
00:53:57,899 --> 00:54:01,926
brought the kind of devastation
that could cut them.

459
00:54:03,638 --> 00:54:08,234
Their fraudulent marriage
and our father's denial of this other son

460
00:54:08,543 --> 00:54:12,707
was, for Chris,
a murder of every day's truth.

461
00:54:13,848 --> 00:54:17,682
He felt his whole life turn,
like a river suddenly reversing

462
00:54:17,785 --> 00:54:21,812
the direction of its flow,
suddenly running uphill.

463
00:54:28,563 --> 00:54:33,159
These revelations struck at the core
of Chris' sense of identity.

464
00:54:33,268 --> 00:54:37,261
They made his entire childhood
seem like fiction.

465
00:54:39,440 --> 00:54:41,067
Chris never told them he knew

466
00:54:44,445 --> 00:54:46,936
and made me promise silence, as well.

467
00:54:47,782 --> 00:54:49,983
I can't afford four.
Who's gonna pay for the fourth one?

468
00:54:50,084 --> 00:54:53,212
Bryan can't afford four. Does it matter?

469
00:54:54,122 --> 00:54:55,612
Can I help you?

470
00:54:55,723 --> 00:54:58,157
Yeah. If I wanted
to paddle down the river,

471
00:54:58,259 --> 00:55:00,420
where's the best place to launch out of?

472
00:55:00,528 --> 00:55:01,654
Hang on a second.

473
00:55:01,763 --> 00:55:04,960
"To launch out of?"
What's your experience level?

474
00:55:06,134 --> 00:55:09,399
- Not much.
- Any? Do you have a permit?

475
00:55:09,504 --> 00:55:11,495
A permit? Permit for what?

476
00:55:12,073 --> 00:55:14,405
You can't paddle down the river
without a permit.

477
00:55:14,509 --> 00:55:16,909
If you want, you can apply for one here,
get some experience,

478
00:55:16,945 --> 00:55:18,845
and I'll put you on the wait-list.

479
00:55:18,947 --> 00:55:21,609
No, I got this guy in here.
We'll figure it out.

480
00:55:21,716 --> 00:55:24,276
There's a wait-list
to paddle down a river?

481
00:55:24,385 --> 00:55:25,750
That's right.

482
00:55:26,087 --> 00:55:28,317
- Yeah, it's gonna be...
- Well, how long do I have to wait?

483
00:55:28,423 --> 00:55:29,890
Yeah, hang on a second.

484
00:55:29,991 --> 00:55:33,984
Now, the deal is
it's gonna be me and you

485
00:55:34,095 --> 00:55:37,428
or it's gonna be me, you and her.

486
00:55:37,532 --> 00:55:42,060
Next available is May 17th, 2003.

487
00:55:42,971 --> 00:55:46,964
Great. Done. The three of us, then.

488
00:55:47,208 --> 00:55:48,641
Twelve years?

489
00:55:49,110 --> 00:55:51,044
- What's that?
- Twelve years?

490
00:55:51,246 --> 00:55:52,804
To paddle down a river.

491
00:55:52,914 --> 00:55:54,711
Let me call you back.

492
00:55:55,383 --> 00:55:57,180
You can do that,

493
00:55:57,285 --> 00:56:00,379
or you can join a commercial raft trip,
go with a licensed guide.

494
00:56:00,488 --> 00:56:02,251
They may have some
last-minute cancellations,

495
00:56:02,357 --> 00:56:04,848
but that's gonna cost you $2,000.

496
00:56:06,661 --> 00:56:08,390
Thank you very much.

497
00:56:46,267 --> 00:56:47,859
Helmet, man!

498
00:57:27,342 --> 00:57:28,536
I'm Supertramp!

499
00:57:41,656 --> 00:57:44,989
"If we admit that human life
can be ruled by reason,

500
00:57:45,793 --> 00:57:48,318
"the possibility of life is destroyed."

501
00:58:18,926 --> 00:58:20,325
Hello!

502
00:58:22,830 --> 00:58:23,956
Hello.

503
00:58:24,699 --> 00:58:27,133
Come. Join us.

504
00:58:28,403 --> 00:58:29,870
We have hot dogs.

505
00:58:45,319 --> 00:58:46,809
- I'm Mads.
- Mads?

506
00:58:46,921 --> 00:58:48,513
- Mads. Hi.
- Mads.

507
00:58:48,623 --> 00:58:50,420
- Alex.
- Hi, Alex.

508
00:58:50,525 --> 00:58:52,516
Hey. I'm Sonja.

509
00:58:53,361 --> 00:58:54,919
Hey, Alex.

510
00:58:56,364 --> 00:59:00,528
We are from Copenhagen,
and you are from the rapids.

511
00:59:01,436 --> 00:59:02,528
I am.

512
00:59:09,710 --> 00:59:11,871
- You're crazy! You're crazy, man.
- My God!

513
00:59:11,979 --> 00:59:14,971
Sonja, get away from him. Get away
from him. He's crazy! Look, he's crazy.

514
00:59:15,082 --> 00:59:17,243
I'll make you a hot dog. One minute.

515
00:59:20,354 --> 00:59:23,517
I love this. Don't you love this?

516
00:59:23,758 --> 00:59:27,125
You know, this is nature.

517
00:59:36,270 --> 00:59:38,135
So where are you going?

518
00:59:38,806 --> 00:59:41,331
- I haven't decided yet.
- Really?

519
00:59:41,442 --> 00:59:44,775
Well, we like it here very much.
And it's so good to meet you, man.

520
00:59:44,879 --> 00:59:45,971
So good to meet you.

521
00:59:46,147 --> 00:59:50,106
You know, we went to Los Angeles,
and then we went to Las Vegas.

522
00:59:50,218 --> 00:59:55,053
Oh, yeah. Las Vegas is very nice.
The universe is so good.

523
00:59:59,994 --> 01:00:02,792
- The universe is very good.
- You know what I mean?

524
01:00:02,897 --> 01:00:05,092
- Yeah.
- The whole universe.

525
01:00:05,299 --> 01:00:09,565
Just the place. The city, she means.
Her English is not very good.

526
01:00:09,737 --> 01:00:14,674
But then we came here. I don't care
if she's a little stupid, but I like her.

527
01:00:15,877 --> 01:00:18,477
You know you can actually go
all the way down to Mexico from here.

528
01:00:18,546 --> 01:00:19,535
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

529
01:00:19,647 --> 01:00:24,175
You can take the kayak,
and you can take it all the way around

530
01:00:24,285 --> 01:00:26,651
down to Hoover Dam,
you can sail around,

531
01:00:26,754 --> 01:00:31,191
and then from there you can take
the river all the way down to Mexico!

532
01:00:31,659 --> 01:00:33,320
- Really?
- Yeah.

533
01:00:37,131 --> 01:00:39,065
Come on, come on!

534
01:00:39,600 --> 01:00:41,898
She's so slow sometimes.

535
01:00:42,937 --> 01:00:46,429
- Here's the map.
- But I like her.

536
01:00:49,343 --> 01:00:51,208
- Here. Hoover Dam.
- Okay.

537
01:00:51,479 --> 01:00:53,709
About 330 kilometers, I think.

538
01:00:53,814 --> 01:00:56,681
- Miles?
- Yeah, miles, about 200 miles.

539
01:00:56,784 --> 01:01:00,811
- Two hundred miles.
- Two hundred miles. Yeah, man.

540
01:01:01,355 --> 01:01:02,795
You know, I wonder if I could paddle

541
01:01:02,890 --> 01:01:04,983
all the way down that
into the Gulf of California.

542
01:01:05,092 --> 01:01:07,925
Yeah, yeah, yeah, you can.
You know, I will go with you.

543
01:01:08,429 --> 01:01:10,920
I will go with you. We leave Sonja here,
and then we take the kayak.

544
01:01:11,032 --> 01:01:13,262
No, no.
We go all the way down into Mexico.

545
01:01:13,367 --> 01:01:18,100
You know, because in every man's
heart, there is a Mexican mistress.

546
01:01:34,855 --> 01:01:36,550
Oh, man.

547
01:01:37,091 --> 01:01:39,389
I've gotta go, you guys.
I'm really sorry. I gotta go.

548
01:01:39,493 --> 01:01:41,324
- What's going on?
- Why?

549
01:01:41,429 --> 01:01:45,024
The river patrol's after me. I'm actually
not supposed to be here, you know.

550
01:01:45,132 --> 01:01:46,724
You have to have, like, a permit,

551
01:01:46,834 --> 01:01:50,463
it's like a government thing to be here,
and I didn't get one.

552
01:01:50,571 --> 01:01:52,436
If you see anybody,
any of the rangers or anything,

553
01:01:52,540 --> 01:01:54,405
just tell them you didn't see me, okay?

554
01:01:54,508 --> 01:01:55,566
Okay.

555
01:01:55,676 --> 01:02:00,170
Okay, again, I'm really, really sorry,
man. I wish I could stay, you know.

556
01:02:00,281 --> 01:02:01,270
Take care, man.

557
01:02:01,382 --> 01:02:02,406
- All right. Take care, Mads.
- Nice to meet you.

558
01:02:02,516 --> 01:02:05,417
- Bye, Alex.
- I wish... I wish I could stay.

559
01:02:05,519 --> 01:02:07,783
Say hello to Mexico from me.

560
01:02:10,257 --> 01:02:12,384
Bye, Alex!

561
01:02:44,725 --> 01:02:47,592
It would be Christmas
in a couple of months,

562
01:02:47,995 --> 01:02:51,556
and the last news we'd had
was about his car being found.

563
01:02:52,266 --> 01:02:56,600
I woke up a couple of days ago,
and for the first time, it bothered me

564
01:02:56,704 --> 01:03:00,105
that it wasn't only my parents
who hadn't heard from Chris.

565
01:03:00,207 --> 01:03:01,333
Honey?

566
01:03:01,442 --> 01:03:05,936
It's me. I'm sorry.
Everything that happened, it's my fault.

567
01:03:07,581 --> 01:03:09,446
Give me another chance.

568
01:03:11,352 --> 01:03:14,788
Please do that... Come on.
Do that for me.

569
01:03:17,858 --> 01:03:20,156
Come on. They're calling
for another quarter right now,

570
01:03:20,261 --> 01:03:22,821
and I ain't got it, so
will you hurry it up?

571
01:03:24,198 --> 01:03:26,257
Come on now, don't hang up on me.

572
01:03:27,201 --> 01:03:30,170
Hey, here's a quarter.

573
01:03:30,271 --> 01:03:31,568
Thank you.

574
01:03:31,839 --> 01:03:35,605
There's a quarter
just happened out of the sky,

575
01:03:35,710 --> 01:03:39,077
so I'm on here talking to you again.

576
01:03:40,314 --> 01:03:43,772
I got the quarter now, let's...
No, no, no, no, no!

577
01:03:48,656 --> 01:03:52,456
I wondered why he hadn't tried to call
in case I might answer.

578
01:03:52,793 --> 01:03:55,284
He could've hung up if it wasn't me.

579
01:03:56,497 --> 01:04:00,092
Why wouldn't he send a letter,
maybe through a friend?

580
01:04:00,201 --> 01:04:01,793
It hurt a little,

581
01:04:04,238 --> 01:04:06,832
but I told myself it was good.

582
01:04:08,976 --> 01:04:12,742
He knew I loved him enough
to bear with the not knowing.

583
01:04:14,915 --> 01:04:19,215
And it helped me remember that there
was something more than rebellion,

584
01:04:19,553 --> 01:04:22,113
more than anger that was driving him.

585
01:04:28,662 --> 01:04:32,393
Chris had always been driven,
had always been an adventurer.

586
01:04:46,647 --> 01:04:48,478
When he was four years old,

587
01:04:48,582 --> 01:04:53,576
he once wandered six blocks away
from home at 3:00 in the morning.

588
01:05:00,327 --> 01:05:02,625
He was found in a neighbor's kitchen

589
01:05:02,730 --> 01:05:05,927
up on a chair,
digging through their candy drawer.

590
01:05:08,435 --> 01:05:13,270
Whatever drawer he was opening now
must have something pretty sweet in it.

591
01:07:11,592 --> 01:07:15,494
- You lived in a cave for 36 days?
- Yes, sir.

592
01:07:15,629 --> 01:07:17,629
And how did you get into Mexico
in the first place?

593
01:07:17,731 --> 01:07:20,256
Through the spillway at Morelos Dam.

594
01:07:20,768 --> 01:07:22,759
River dries out pretty quickly
beyond there, doesn't it?

595
01:07:22,870 --> 01:07:27,603
Yeah. Turns into a maze of irrigation
canals, thanks to our dams up north.

596
01:07:28,075 --> 01:07:31,943
So I ported my kayak over the desert,
and I hitched down to Golfo.

597
01:07:33,180 --> 01:07:37,276
But after a few weeks, a sandstorm
came up and blew the kayak away.

598
01:07:37,685 --> 01:07:39,983
So I walked back north. Here I am.

599
01:07:40,087 --> 01:07:43,784
Well, you just can't be crossing
the borders without any identification.

600
01:07:43,891 --> 01:07:45,756
- Are we understood?
- Yes, sir.

601
01:07:45,859 --> 01:07:48,293
I've eaten enough sand to send me
back to the city anyway.

602
01:07:48,395 --> 01:07:51,057
All right. Sit tight. I'll be right back.

603
01:07:52,499 --> 01:07:56,526
Some may ask,
"Why act now? Why not wait?"

604
01:07:57,371 --> 01:08:01,068
The answer is clear.
The world could wait no longer.

605
01:10:27,755 --> 01:10:29,416
Hi. Do you have the time?

606
01:10:29,924 --> 01:10:31,357
- Time?
- Time?

607
01:10:31,459 --> 01:10:32,653
Yeah.

608
01:10:33,995 --> 01:10:35,394
Okay.

609
01:11:16,337 --> 01:11:17,668
Front and back.

610
01:11:17,805 --> 01:11:21,764
I don't have any more clipboards,
so get one from the other fellas.

611
01:11:22,043 --> 01:11:23,510
- Next.
- Hi.

612
01:11:23,778 --> 01:11:26,144
Can you tell me how to get an ID?

613
01:11:26,347 --> 01:11:29,077
- Did you lose your identification, sir?
- Yeah.

614
01:11:29,183 --> 01:11:31,708
No birth certificate? Nothing?

615
01:11:31,986 --> 01:11:33,317
Ouch.

616
01:11:33,421 --> 01:11:37,152
All right. Well, you're gonna
have to work that out with the DMV.

617
01:11:37,258 --> 01:11:41,524
You can catch them in the morning.
The closest one is Montebello,

618
01:11:42,563 --> 01:11:44,554
and we can help you
with the bus voucher.

619
01:11:44,665 --> 01:11:46,724
So just come to this desk
when you're ready for the voucher.

620
01:11:46,834 --> 01:11:48,426
- Okay.
- What's your name?

621
01:11:48,536 --> 01:11:52,165
- Alexander Supertramp.
- What's that?

622
01:11:52,273 --> 01:11:58,143
- Alexander Supertramp.
- Supertramp. Really?

623
01:11:58,412 --> 01:11:59,379
Yeah.

624
01:12:00,548 --> 01:12:04,245
Okay, so I'm gonna look for you,
Supertramp. I got something for you.

625
01:12:06,787 --> 01:12:09,187
- Here you go, Supertramp.
- Thank you very much.

626
01:12:09,290 --> 01:12:10,552
Okay, baby.

627
01:12:10,658 --> 01:12:13,684
- And one last thing.
- Yeah.

628
01:12:15,630 --> 01:12:18,030
Do you have a bed for me? I'm sorry...

629
01:12:18,132 --> 01:12:21,932
Oh, no. Sure, I got a bed for you.
Sign your name right here.

630
01:12:22,036 --> 01:12:27,201
You fill this out. And I'll set you right up.
Now, I'm out of...

631
01:12:27,308 --> 01:12:30,141
- What's going on back there?
- I got it. I'm sorry.

632
01:12:30,244 --> 01:12:33,611
- Come on, now. Work with me.
- All right. Thanks, ma'am.

633
01:12:33,714 --> 01:12:35,978
Supertramp, huh?

634
01:12:38,953 --> 01:12:40,853
You know the drill.

635
01:13:14,121 --> 01:13:15,611
Move it!

636
01:14:03,237 --> 01:14:05,865
Thanks, but I'm not gonna need
that bed after all.

637
01:14:05,973 --> 01:14:08,134
You leaving us so soon? Supertramp!

638
01:15:11,872 --> 01:15:16,172
Show me your face.
I never, ever, ever forget a face.

639
01:15:16,610 --> 01:15:19,579
If I see yours again,
I won't arrest you, I'll kill you.

640
01:15:19,679 --> 01:15:21,544
This is the goddamned railroad,

641
01:15:21,648 --> 01:15:23,275
and we will do whatever we have to do

642
01:15:23,383 --> 01:15:25,783
to keep you freeloaders
from violating our liability.

643
01:15:25,886 --> 01:15:27,114
Yes, sir.

644
01:15:30,891 --> 01:15:32,483
You got any ID?

645
01:15:33,860 --> 01:15:37,057
- No, sir.
- Of course you don't.

646
01:15:37,964 --> 01:15:39,727
Last time, my friend.

647
01:15:40,867 --> 01:15:42,164
All clear.

648
01:15:50,210 --> 01:15:51,575
Good boy!

649
01:16:09,663 --> 01:16:12,791
Yeah! That's what I'm talking about.
Finally!

650
01:16:15,969 --> 01:16:19,097
It's a mystery to me

651
01:16:19,973 --> 01:16:25,309
We have a greed
With which we have agreed

652
01:16:26,780 --> 01:16:31,581
You think you have to want more
than you need

653
01:16:32,819 --> 01:16:37,483
Until you have it all you won't be freed

654
01:16:40,427 --> 01:16:45,831
Society, you're a crazy breed

655
01:16:46,399 --> 01:16:52,338
I hope you're not lonely without me

656
01:16:55,809 --> 01:17:00,803
When you want more than you have
You think you need

657
01:17:01,748 --> 01:17:06,742
And when you think more than you want
Your thoughts begin to bleed

658
01:17:08,188 --> 01:17:12,648
I think I need to find a bigger place

659
01:17:13,693 --> 01:17:16,161
'Cause when you have
more than you think

660
01:17:16,263 --> 01:17:18,493
You need more space

661
01:17:21,901 --> 01:17:27,271
Society, you're a crazy breed

662
01:17:27,807 --> 01:17:32,744
I hope you're not lonely without me

663
01:17:33,780 --> 01:17:38,683
Society, crazy indeed

664
01:17:39,486 --> 01:17:45,789
I hope you're not lonely without me

665
01:18:35,375 --> 01:18:36,808
Thanks a lot.

666
01:18:46,086 --> 01:18:48,987
In the letters
Chris wrote me from college,

667
01:18:49,556 --> 01:18:53,754
it was clear his anguish and problems
with Mom and Dad had continued.

668
01:19:03,236 --> 01:19:05,101
He said I was
the only person in the world

669
01:19:05,205 --> 01:19:07,833
who could possibly understand
what he had to say.

670
01:19:07,941 --> 01:19:10,910
With whose money are you buying
all these goddamn presents?

671
01:19:11,010 --> 01:19:13,410
I work. The only reason
I'm not talking is because

672
01:19:13,513 --> 01:19:16,274
you're wandering around acting like
the big-shot flirt with everybody.

673
01:19:16,282 --> 01:19:19,809
I am making the contacts
for this business to work!

674
01:19:19,986 --> 01:19:21,920
You don't care at all about what I do!

675
01:19:22,021 --> 01:19:23,852
I don't even want to talk to you
about it anymore!

676
01:19:23,957 --> 01:19:26,983
Don't you walk away from me, woman!
Woman!

677
01:19:27,660 --> 01:19:29,992
Kids! Look what your dad
is doing to me!

678
01:19:30,196 --> 01:19:33,529
For God's sake,
look what your mother is making me do!

679
01:19:33,633 --> 01:19:35,601
Fuck you! I hate you!

680
01:19:38,004 --> 01:19:41,132
There ain't gonna be no party.
I'm gonna cancel Christmas this year.

681
01:19:41,274 --> 01:19:44,539
Cancel Christmas?
Who do you think you are? God?

682
01:19:44,644 --> 01:19:46,407
That's right! I'm God!

683
01:19:46,546 --> 01:19:49,344
Well, you're not God.
You can't cancel Christmas.

684
01:19:49,616 --> 01:19:50,947
That's bullshit!

685
01:21:47,066 --> 01:21:48,556
We're 10 deep!

686
01:21:56,476 --> 01:22:01,243
Alex, I don't mean to be on you about
everything. You're doing a great job.

687
01:22:01,481 --> 01:22:05,144
I wanna keep you on and
we all wanna help you get to Alaska,

688
01:22:05,852 --> 01:22:08,446
but you've got to start wearing socks.

689
01:22:16,396 --> 01:22:20,093
With almost a year having passed
since Chris' disappearance,

690
01:22:20,667 --> 01:22:24,034
my parents' anger, their desperation,

691
01:22:24,137 --> 01:22:26,401
their guilt was giving way to pain.

692
01:22:29,442 --> 01:22:32,036
And pain seemed to bring them closer.

693
01:22:34,414 --> 01:22:36,575
Even their faces had changed.

694
01:23:02,809 --> 01:23:05,243
She convinces herself it's Chris,

695
01:23:06,646 --> 01:23:09,114
that it's her son
whenever she passes a stray.

696
01:23:09,115 --> 01:23:10,916
That it's her son
whenever she passes a stray.

697
01:23:11,784 --> 01:23:14,150
And I fear for the mother in her.

698
01:23:17,857 --> 01:23:22,817
Instincts that seem to sense the threat
of a loss so huge

699
01:23:22,929 --> 01:23:27,593
and irrevocable that the mind balks
at taking its measure.

700
01:23:29,836 --> 01:23:34,398
I'd begin to wonder if I can understand
all that Chris is saying any longer,

701
01:23:37,610 --> 01:23:40,545
but I catch myself and remember that

702
01:23:40,647 --> 01:23:43,013
these are not the parents
he grew up with,

703
01:23:44,317 --> 01:23:48,913
but people softened by the forced
reflection that comes with loss.

704
01:23:53,559 --> 01:23:58,587
Still, everything Chris is saying
has to be said.

705
01:24:00,366 --> 01:24:04,234
And I trust for him that
everything he is doing has to be done.

706
01:24:06,039 --> 01:24:07,631
This is our life.

707
01:25:15,374 --> 01:25:18,969
Big game. Very big game.

708
01:25:19,445 --> 01:25:20,605
Got it.

709
01:27:11,591 --> 01:27:12,922
Damn it!

710
01:27:17,296 --> 01:27:18,593
Get off!

711
01:28:01,540 --> 01:28:04,941
"Hey, Dad, can I light the barbeque,
please, Dad, this time?"

712
01:28:05,578 --> 01:28:07,045
"Well, Son,
you can go get the lighter fluid."

713
01:28:07,146 --> 01:28:09,580
"Come on, Dad. Please, Dad, please?"

714
01:28:10,316 --> 01:28:12,876
"Well, why not, Walt?
That sounds like a good idea..."

715
01:28:12,985 --> 01:28:14,850
"Shut up, Carine! Shut up, Carine!

716
01:28:14,954 --> 01:28:19,414
"No, Billie. I told you once.
Don't make me tell you again. Okay?

717
01:28:19,792 --> 01:28:21,419
"Okay?

718
01:28:21,727 --> 01:28:23,388
"You hear me? You hear me, woman?

719
01:28:23,496 --> 01:28:26,431
"You hear me, woman? Huh?
You hear me, woman?"

720
01:28:28,834 --> 01:28:34,204
"Sorry. Sorry, Walt. I'm sorry."

721
01:28:47,453 --> 01:28:48,613
Shit.

722
01:28:54,727 --> 01:29:01,792
No! No! Damn it!

723
01:29:02,335 --> 01:29:04,997
God damn it! Fuck!

724
01:29:48,381 --> 01:29:53,444
"There was clearly felt the presence of
a force not bound to be kind to man.

725
01:29:54,754 --> 01:29:58,246
"It was a place of heathenism
and superstitious rites,

726
01:29:59,625 --> 01:30:02,992
"to be inhabited by men
nearer of kin to the rocks

727
01:30:03,262 --> 01:30:05,753
"and to the wild animals than we."

728
01:30:28,454 --> 01:30:29,648
Sunni.

729
01:30:30,189 --> 01:30:33,181
Hey, Sunni! Come here, baby.

730
01:30:38,764 --> 01:30:41,358
No. No!

731
01:31:15,034 --> 01:31:18,333
But now all I'm focused on
is just Alaska.

732
01:31:18,437 --> 01:31:19,995
- Yeah.
- Alaska.

733
01:31:21,974 --> 01:31:24,966
All right. Let's hear it for Insane Cain!

734
01:31:28,447 --> 01:31:30,815
Let's give it up
for Slab City's own Tracy T!

735
01:31:30,816 --> 01:31:32,576
Let's give it up
for Slab City's own Tracy T!

736
01:31:40,292 --> 01:31:42,192
Hey. My name's Tracy.

737
01:31:42,294 --> 01:31:44,057
- Tracy!
- Yeah!

738
01:32:14,160 --> 01:32:16,754
Jack London is king.

739
01:32:17,930 --> 01:32:20,023
Hey, you gonna stay with us long?

740
01:32:20,833 --> 01:32:22,994
Well, I'm waiting on a check
from my last job

741
01:32:23,102 --> 01:32:25,434
to come into Salton City
the day after Christmas.

742
01:32:25,538 --> 01:32:28,336
I've got to start thinking about
getting ready for Alaska.

743
01:32:28,440 --> 01:32:32,968
When the sun gets a little lower tonight,
I'm going to start a calisthenics routine.

744
01:32:33,345 --> 01:32:36,075
After the check comes in,
I think I'm gonna try to find

745
01:32:36,182 --> 01:32:39,481
some big old mountains I can climb
every day until spring comes.

746
01:32:39,585 --> 01:32:41,712
I've got to see
how far the money's gonna go.

747
01:32:41,820 --> 01:32:45,347
I've still got a lot of supplies
to pick up before spring.

748
01:32:46,258 --> 01:32:50,752
So, I might get another job
or I might be okay.

749
01:32:51,330 --> 01:32:55,494
Hell, we'd give you a little something for
the days you spend in the booth here.

750
01:32:55,601 --> 01:32:58,035
I'm not taking
any money from you, Rainey.

751
01:32:58,537 --> 01:33:01,438
It's been a real great twist
meeting you two.

752
01:33:01,540 --> 01:33:03,701
You two look like you're doing good.

753
01:33:04,043 --> 01:33:06,011
- We are doing good.
- Yeah?

754
01:33:06,111 --> 01:33:07,271
We're doing real good.

755
01:33:08,013 --> 01:33:10,982
Speaking of which, don't you think

756
01:33:11,083 --> 01:33:15,383
you ought to introduce yourself
to our little Joni Mitchell over there?

757
01:33:19,858 --> 01:33:20,825
I...

758
01:33:55,661 --> 01:33:58,186
- Hi.
- Hi.

759
01:34:03,869 --> 01:34:05,803
You selling these books?

760
01:34:06,105 --> 01:34:08,903
I am. We are.

761
01:34:10,209 --> 01:34:11,506
He was.

762
01:34:15,281 --> 01:34:16,771
I like to read.

763
01:34:17,650 --> 01:34:20,141
- Do you?
- Yeah.

764
01:34:20,853 --> 01:34:22,616
That's good.

765
01:34:23,856 --> 01:34:27,519
I heard you play your song last night.

766
01:34:28,761 --> 01:34:33,460
- I'm terrible.
- You are not terrible. You sing sweet.

767
01:34:34,333 --> 01:34:35,630
Thank you.

768
01:34:39,071 --> 01:34:42,199
I was gonna go take a walk
to Salvation Mountain.

769
01:34:42,908 --> 01:34:45,638
- You wanna go?
- Okay.

770
01:34:54,119 --> 01:34:56,485
- Hi.
- Hi. Alex.

771
01:34:57,323 --> 01:35:03,057
I'd like to show you around up here.
I've been here since 1984, more or less.

772
01:35:05,864 --> 01:35:07,593
A lot of tourists come in here

773
01:35:07,700 --> 01:35:11,466
and they look at that car door up there.
They really like it.

774
01:35:12,371 --> 01:35:16,364
And I found car doors and put them
up there and I bolted it all in.

775
01:35:16,475 --> 01:35:17,995
Where did you get the telephone poles?

776
01:35:18,043 --> 01:35:20,876
A lot of people in the valley
just love me a lot.

777
01:35:21,013 --> 01:35:23,538
Everybody now, I think,
in the whole world is just loving me.

778
01:35:23,649 --> 01:35:26,846
And I want to have the wisdom
to love them back.

779
01:35:27,920 --> 01:35:30,514
And that's about it.
So I really get excited.

780
01:35:30,622 --> 01:35:32,283
You really believe in love, then.

781
01:35:32,391 --> 01:35:34,723
Yeah. Totally.

782
01:35:35,427 --> 01:35:40,296
This is a love story that is staggering
to everybody in the whole world.

783
01:35:40,399 --> 01:35:43,232
That God really loves us a lot.

784
01:35:44,303 --> 01:35:45,770
Does that answer that?

785
01:35:45,871 --> 01:35:47,463
- Yeah.
- Good.

786
01:35:49,475 --> 01:35:53,707
I really love it here. I think the freedom
of this place is just so beautiful.

787
01:35:53,812 --> 01:35:57,714
To me, I wouldn't move for $10 million,
unless I had to.

788
01:35:59,551 --> 01:36:03,214
So I'm contented here in the desert,
and I'm living where I want to live.

789
01:36:03,489 --> 01:36:08,984
And I think good gets better.
And I think those great big tanks there

790
01:36:09,094 --> 01:36:12,689
were the sewer plant for
the Marine base in World War II.

791
01:36:15,334 --> 01:36:17,996
If you want to,
you can try putting your hands in there.

792
01:36:18,103 --> 01:36:21,266
And I'm gonna do the same thing,
just for the fun.

793
01:36:21,974 --> 01:36:23,839
You're doing real good.

794
01:36:27,279 --> 01:36:30,612
You can wipe your hands off on my shirt
if you want.

795
01:36:50,969 --> 01:36:53,460
This is starting to make me hungry.

796
01:36:54,273 --> 01:36:58,300
I was just a couple of years older
than Tracy when I got pregnant.

797
01:37:02,181 --> 01:37:03,739
- Wow.
- Yeah.

798
01:37:05,584 --> 01:37:09,680
Yeah, I thought my husband and I were
going to just make peace on Earth

799
01:37:10,489 --> 01:37:13,253
and babies and love
and stay together forever,

800
01:37:15,828 --> 01:37:18,661
and that didn't quite work out that way.

801
01:37:18,764 --> 01:37:21,324
He left me.

802
01:37:25,537 --> 01:37:27,198
So, I...

803
01:37:29,208 --> 01:37:30,197
Anyway, whatever,

804
01:37:30,309 --> 01:37:35,303
but I ended up raising Reno on my own.
That's my boy, his name's Reno.

805
01:37:36,982 --> 01:37:38,643
Then I met Rainey.

806
01:37:39,852 --> 01:37:42,878
That was sweet. It was really
good for a while. It's just...

807
01:37:47,960 --> 01:37:52,556
You know, Reno was
a teenager already by then,

808
01:37:52,698 --> 01:37:55,861
and he was just on his way
to becoming his own man.

809
01:38:00,506 --> 01:38:05,967
And I haven't even heard from him
in two years.

810
01:38:09,748 --> 01:38:11,943
I don't even know where he is.

811
01:38:12,518 --> 01:38:14,918
I hope I get to meet him sometime.

812
01:38:17,356 --> 01:38:19,722
Do your folks know where you are?

813
01:38:24,663 --> 01:38:27,723
Hey, guys?
Dinner's ready if you guys are hungry.

814
01:38:27,833 --> 01:38:31,564
Yeah, we are. We're hungry.

815
01:38:35,140 --> 01:38:36,732
I'll be all right.

816
01:38:47,586 --> 01:38:49,281
You want to come and eat?

817
01:38:49,888 --> 01:38:53,289
Or we'll sit here.
Because I will sit here with you all night.

818
01:38:58,564 --> 01:39:00,054
Let's go. Let's go.

819
01:39:02,734 --> 01:39:04,793
Guys, come on. It's getting cold.

820
01:39:08,473 --> 01:39:13,570
Check this out. Tawdry?
Denise, that sounds like your cup of tea.

821
01:39:43,408 --> 01:39:47,367
That poor girl is about ready
to vault herself onto a fence post.

822
01:39:48,246 --> 01:39:52,546
And here you are,
the monk of Jack fucking LaLanne.

823
01:39:59,458 --> 01:40:00,124
- So Jan talked to you about Reno, huh?
- Yeah.

824
01:40:00,125 --> 01:40:03,458
- So Jan talked to you about Reno, huh?
- Yeah.

825
01:40:06,498 --> 01:40:10,195
Children can be pretty harsh
when it comes to their parents.

826
01:40:10,769 --> 01:40:12,930
You planning on seeing yours?

827
01:40:15,240 --> 01:40:17,538
I've only got one plan, Rainey.

828
01:40:18,644 --> 01:40:21,272
That would be Alaska?

829
01:40:21,513 --> 01:40:22,912
Alaska.

830
01:40:34,459 --> 01:40:35,585
Hello?

831
01:40:37,295 --> 01:40:40,287
- Merry Christmas.
- Come in here.

832
01:40:49,474 --> 01:40:51,499
My parents went into town.

833
01:40:53,211 --> 01:40:54,200
No.

834
01:40:54,546 --> 01:40:57,674
Yeah. They went to call my grandma
for Christmas.

835
01:40:58,417 --> 01:41:00,510
No, I mean we can't do that.

836
01:41:01,787 --> 01:41:02,981
Why not?

837
01:41:10,228 --> 01:41:11,786
How old are you?

838
01:41:12,764 --> 01:41:13,992
Eighteen.

839
01:41:17,135 --> 01:41:18,602
Seventeen.

840
01:41:20,472 --> 01:41:22,406
What year were you born?

841
01:41:29,281 --> 01:41:30,873
So I'm 16.

842
01:41:45,030 --> 01:41:47,430
You want to do something together?

843
01:43:01,439 --> 01:43:06,069
You can send mail to this address
in South Dakota.

844
01:43:07,746 --> 01:43:12,080
I don't know when I'm going to get it,
but I'll get it.

845
01:43:16,421 --> 01:43:18,150
You're pretty magic.

846
01:43:18,290 --> 01:43:20,918
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

847
01:43:22,894 --> 01:43:24,521
And just remember

848
01:43:24,930 --> 01:43:29,390
if you want something in life,
reach out and grab it.

849
01:43:50,755 --> 01:43:52,746
- You take care, kiddo.
- You, too.

850
01:43:55,093 --> 01:43:58,119
- New Year's resolution?
- We'll work on it.

851
01:45:05,997 --> 01:45:08,761
Just get your pack
and get on out of here, okay?

852
01:45:09,935 --> 01:45:12,301
I don't think I could take a hug.

853
01:45:27,018 --> 01:45:27,985
Hey.

854
01:45:40,598 --> 01:45:41,622
Bye!

855
01:45:56,514 --> 01:46:01,076
A year and a half had passed in what
Dad called "suspended animation."

856
01:46:08,693 --> 01:46:14,563
The weight of Chris' disappearance had
begun to lay down on me full-length.

857
01:46:25,944 --> 01:46:28,139
"I have lived through much,

858
01:46:29,247 --> 01:46:32,944
"and now I think I have found what is
needed for happiness.

859
01:46:36,788 --> 01:46:39,484
"A quiet secluded life in the country,

860
01:46:41,393 --> 01:46:46,126
"with the possibility of being useful to
people to whom it is easy to do good,

861
01:46:47,932 --> 01:46:51,368
"and who are not accustomed
to have it done to them.

862
01:46:53,238 --> 01:46:56,332
"And work which one hopes
may be of some use.

863
01:46:58,009 --> 01:47:02,309
"Then rest, nature, books, music,

864
01:47:03,048 --> 01:47:05,039
"love for one's neighbor.

865
01:47:09,020 --> 01:47:11,454
"Such is my idea of happiness.

866
01:47:14,392 --> 01:47:20,956
"And then, on top of all that,
you for a mate,

867
01:47:22,167 --> 01:47:24,101
"and children perhaps.

868
01:47:26,004 --> 01:47:28,802
"What more
can the heart of a man desire?"

869
01:47:37,148 --> 01:47:41,551
Comes the morning when I can feel

870
01:47:41,653 --> 01:47:45,987
That there's nothing
left to be concealed

871
01:47:46,091 --> 01:47:50,528
Moving on a scene surreal

872
01:47:50,628 --> 01:47:56,692
But my heart will never
Never be far from here

873
01:47:56,801 --> 01:48:01,101
Sure as I'm breathing
Sure as I'm sad

874
01:48:01,206 --> 01:48:02,773
I'll keep this wisdom in my flesh

875
01:48:02,774 --> 01:48:05,675
I'll keep this wisdom in my flesh

876
01:48:05,777 --> 01:48:10,407
I leave here believing
More than I had

877
01:48:10,515 --> 01:48:14,144
And there's a reason I will

878
01:48:14,252 --> 01:48:18,416
A reason I'll be back

879
01:48:22,060 --> 01:48:26,429
As I walk the hemisphere

880
01:48:26,531 --> 01:48:30,865
I got my wish to up and disappear

881
01:48:30,969 --> 01:48:35,303
I've been wounded
I've been healed

882
01:48:35,406 --> 01:48:38,500
Now for landing I've been

883
01:48:38,610 --> 01:48:41,511
Landing I've been cleared

884
01:48:41,613 --> 01:48:46,141
Sure as I'm breathing
Sure as I'm sad

885
01:48:46,251 --> 01:48:50,585
I'll keep this wisdom in my flesh

886
01:48:50,688 --> 01:48:55,125
I leave here believing
More than I had

887
01:48:55,226 --> 01:48:59,219
This love has got no ceiling

888
01:52:06,951 --> 01:52:08,578
Where's your camp?

889
01:52:09,420 --> 01:52:11,911
Just out past Oh-My-God Hot Springs.

890
01:52:12,757 --> 01:52:15,817
I've lived in and around here
for six years now

891
01:52:16,394 --> 01:52:18,453
and I've never heard of any place
that goes by that name.

892
01:52:18,563 --> 01:52:21,498
- Show me how to get there.
- Yeah.

893
01:52:25,169 --> 01:52:27,763
- Ron Franz.
- Alex.

894
01:52:27,939 --> 01:52:29,736
Alex? Where you from, Alex?

895
01:52:30,675 --> 01:52:34,634
- West Virginia.
- Okay, Alex from West Virginia.

896
01:53:19,724 --> 01:53:24,423
Well, this is something out here.

897
01:53:29,367 --> 01:53:30,561
Don't you...

898
01:53:31,602 --> 01:53:36,301
Don't you worry about those dope
smokers and nudists down below there?

899
01:53:36,407 --> 01:53:40,207
No, they keep to themselves
pretty much.

900
01:53:40,311 --> 01:53:43,576
You strike me as a bright young man.
Am I wrong about that?

901
01:53:44,849 --> 01:53:47,249
I think I've got
my head on my shoulders pretty good.

902
01:53:47,351 --> 01:53:49,046
Well, that's what I mean.

903
01:53:53,758 --> 01:53:55,817
How long you been out here?

904
01:53:57,462 --> 01:54:00,659
- Couple of weeks.
- And before that?

905
01:54:01,165 --> 01:54:04,293
A lot of places.
Been moving around a lot.

906
01:54:05,470 --> 01:54:08,633
- Well, how old are you?
- Twenty-three.

907
01:54:09,607 --> 01:54:10,835
Twenty-three years old!

908
01:54:10,942 --> 01:54:13,934
Son, don't you think
you ought to be getting an education?

909
01:54:14,045 --> 01:54:16,980
And a job?
And making something of this life?

910
01:54:20,251 --> 01:54:21,809
Look, Mr. Franz,

911
01:54:23,020 --> 01:54:26,888
I think careers are a 20th century
invention, and I don't want one.

912
01:54:27,892 --> 01:54:31,658
You don't need to worry about me.
I have a college education.

913
01:54:31,963 --> 01:54:36,093
I'm not destitute.
I'm living like this by choice.

914
01:54:37,802 --> 01:54:42,136
- In the dirt?
- Yeah, in the dirt.

915
01:54:46,477 --> 01:54:50,140
- Where's your family?
- Don't have one anymore.

916
01:54:53,518 --> 01:54:55,008
That's a shame.

917
01:54:58,356 --> 01:55:01,052
Hey, Mr. Franz,
I want to show you something.

918
01:55:01,826 --> 01:55:03,020
Come on.

919
01:55:05,830 --> 01:55:07,024
Come on.

920
01:55:32,690 --> 01:55:38,060
It's getting a little steep.
A little high for me, kid.

921
01:55:39,564 --> 01:55:41,054
All right,

922
01:55:42,366 --> 01:55:45,631
but even from halfway out,
it's quite a sight, isn't it?

923
01:55:47,705 --> 01:55:52,506
From the top, you can see all the way
to the Salton Sea, too.

924
01:55:53,210 --> 01:55:55,610
You can see the Salton Sea
from up there?

925
01:55:55,947 --> 01:55:57,175
Yes, sir.

926
01:55:58,015 --> 01:55:59,380
My goodness.

927
01:56:00,484 --> 01:56:05,285
- You don't want to go up?
- Nope. I don't do these kind of things.

928
01:56:08,960 --> 01:56:11,326
I spent most of my life in the Army.

929
01:56:14,198 --> 01:56:18,897
New Year's Eve, 1957,
I was stationed in Okinawa.

930
01:56:20,438 --> 01:56:24,431
My wife and son were here in the States
just driving down the road,

931
01:56:24,542 --> 01:56:28,034
and some fella who'd had too much
to drink plowed right into them.

932
01:56:28,613 --> 01:56:30,604
Killed them both.

933
01:56:35,019 --> 01:56:40,116
Now you might think
the last thing I would do in the world

934
01:56:42,994 --> 01:56:44,723
is go to the whiskey.

935
01:56:46,497 --> 01:56:50,661
But at the time,
it felt like the only thing I could do.

936
01:56:50,768 --> 01:56:53,362
And I did it hard!

937
01:56:56,407 --> 01:56:58,875
But pretty soon I realized

938
01:56:59,644 --> 01:57:03,876
I wasn't doing my wife and son any good
mourning them with the bottle.

939
01:57:04,281 --> 01:57:08,308
So I pulled myself together
and I quit drinking,

940
01:57:08,986 --> 01:57:10,351
cold turkey.

941
01:57:11,656 --> 01:57:16,025
So since all that, this is pretty much me.

942
01:57:17,361 --> 01:57:19,556
Do you ever travel, Mr. Franz?

943
01:57:20,631 --> 01:57:23,691
No, I can't seem to get too far
from my leather.

944
01:57:25,436 --> 01:57:29,964
I do a lot of leather engraving.
I got a little workshop out in the garage.

945
01:57:30,341 --> 01:57:32,536
Between that and my pension,
I do pretty well.

946
01:57:32,643 --> 01:57:35,168
But every time I think
I might take a trip somewhere,

947
01:57:35,279 --> 01:57:38,874
I get too far behind on orders and such
to consider it.

948
01:57:39,784 --> 01:57:42,446
When we finish eating,
I'd love to see your workshop.

949
01:57:42,553 --> 01:57:43,952
- Would you?
- Oh, yeah.

950
01:57:44,055 --> 01:57:45,818
I was hoping you'd say that.

951
01:57:45,923 --> 01:57:48,858
- It's amazing how malleable this is.
- Yeah, it is.

952
01:57:48,959 --> 01:57:50,654
When the leather is wet you can really...

953
01:57:50,761 --> 01:57:52,058
- It's like butter.
- Yeah.

954
01:57:52,163 --> 01:57:55,655
It's amazing. And then it hardens up,
and, I mean, it stays right there.

955
01:58:40,778 --> 01:58:46,375
A good whack with the mallet.
Crack it down. Whack. Bang.

956
01:59:46,777 --> 01:59:50,440
I went to South Dakota.
I worked at a grain elevator

957
01:59:50,548 --> 01:59:53,039
for this guy named Wayne.
He was a really good guy.

958
01:59:53,150 --> 01:59:54,742
So I took the Colorado River

959
01:59:54,852 --> 01:59:58,117
all the way down through
the Grand Canyon and did rapids,

960
01:59:58,222 --> 02:00:01,817
which is by far one of
the scariest things I've ever done.

961
02:00:01,959 --> 02:00:07,295
And I took the Colorado down into
Mexico, Golfo, where I got stuck.

962
02:00:08,232 --> 02:00:10,530
Salvation Mountain. The Slabs.

963
02:00:12,269 --> 02:00:14,362
What's the "N" stand for?

964
02:00:16,006 --> 02:00:17,132
North.

965
02:00:18,475 --> 02:00:20,102
Alaska?

966
02:00:23,147 --> 02:00:25,615
Son, what the hell
are you running from?

967
02:00:26,784 --> 02:00:29,218
You know, I can ask you
the same question!

968
02:00:30,287 --> 02:00:32,653
Except I already know the answer!

969
02:00:33,524 --> 02:00:35,014
You do, do you?

970
02:00:35,793 --> 02:00:39,991
I do, Mr. Franz!
You got to get back out in the world!

971
02:00:40,831 --> 02:00:44,028
Get out of that lonely house,
that little workshop of yours.

972
02:00:44,134 --> 02:00:48,127
Get back out on the road! Really!

973
02:00:49,073 --> 02:00:51,667
You're going to live a long time, Ron!

974
02:00:51,775 --> 02:00:55,006
You should make a radical change
in your lifestyle!

975
02:00:55,713 --> 02:00:59,615
I mean, the core of man's spirit
comes from new experiences.

976
02:01:00,184 --> 02:01:04,348
And there you are, stubborn old man,
sitting on your butt.

977
02:01:05,522 --> 02:01:08,320
- Sitting on my butt?
- Yeah.

978
02:01:09,927 --> 02:01:14,296
I'll show you sitting on my butt!

979
02:01:14,431 --> 02:01:16,422
"Stubborn old man."

980
02:01:17,935 --> 02:01:19,527
I'll show you!

981
02:01:20,070 --> 02:01:22,265
Come on, then! Come on.

982
02:01:25,242 --> 02:01:28,336
Sitting on my butt? Yeah.

983
02:01:30,481 --> 02:01:32,608
Come on, old man. Come climbing.

984
02:01:32,716 --> 02:01:34,411
Sitting on my butt.

985
02:01:34,785 --> 02:01:36,252
Come on. Keep going!

986
02:01:40,124 --> 02:01:41,819
You're doing great!

987
02:01:46,664 --> 02:01:49,258
- Keep going. Keep going, Ron!
- Yeah!

988
02:01:51,068 --> 02:01:54,799
Can anybody see this?
God, are you watching this right now?

989
02:02:03,013 --> 02:02:04,071
Yeah.

990
02:02:07,184 --> 02:02:11,450
- You all right?
- You little pinhead!

991
02:02:29,039 --> 02:02:31,303
I'm gonna miss you when you go.

992
02:02:32,977 --> 02:02:36,640
I'll miss you, too, Ron.
But you're wrong if you think

993
02:02:36,747 --> 02:02:40,683
that the joy of life comes principally
from human relationships.

994
02:02:41,719 --> 02:02:44,017
God's placed it all around us.
It's in everything.

995
02:02:44,121 --> 02:02:46,453
It's in anything we can experience.

996
02:02:47,358 --> 02:02:50,850
People just need to change the way
they look at those things.

997
02:02:50,961 --> 02:02:53,122
Yeah, I'm gonna take stock of that.

998
02:02:55,065 --> 02:02:56,293
No, I am.

999
02:03:00,537 --> 02:03:00,871
I am.

1000
02:03:00,872 --> 02:03:01,599
I am.

1001
02:03:04,008 --> 02:03:06,169
But I wanted to tell you something.

1002
02:03:09,980 --> 02:03:12,676
From the bits and pieces I put together,

1003
02:03:12,816 --> 02:03:16,843
you know, from what you told me about
your family, your mother and your dad.

1004
02:03:18,889 --> 02:03:22,222
And I know you've got your problems
with the church, too.

1005
02:03:24,161 --> 02:03:27,858
But there's some kind of bigger thing
we can all appreciate,

1006
02:03:28,932 --> 02:03:32,095
and it sounds like
you don't mind calling it God.

1007
02:03:38,208 --> 02:03:41,109
But when you forgive,

1008
02:03:43,380 --> 02:03:44,608
you love.

1009
02:03:48,385 --> 02:03:51,411
And when you love,

1010
02:03:52,256 --> 02:03:54,816
God's light shines on you.

1011
02:03:59,563 --> 02:04:03,226
- Holy shit.
- I told you about that language.

1012
02:04:13,444 --> 02:04:14,934
I told you so!

1013
02:04:17,848 --> 02:04:21,340
Where are the fucking animals now?
I'm hungry!

1014
02:04:21,518 --> 02:04:25,682
I'm fucking hungry! I'm fucking hungry!

1015
02:04:42,773 --> 02:04:46,504
"For a moment she rediscovered
the purpose of her life.

1016
02:04:47,411 --> 02:04:51,108
"She was here on earth to grasp
the meaning of its wild enchantment,

1017
02:04:51,215 --> 02:04:54,013
"and to call each thing
by its right name."

1018
02:04:57,354 --> 02:04:58,981
"By its right name."

1019
02:04:59,790 --> 02:05:02,088
What is this? What is this one?

1020
02:05:05,195 --> 02:05:10,098
This is Viburnum edule.
Viburnum edule.

1021
02:05:14,972 --> 02:05:17,941
Hedysarum alpinum.

1022
02:05:20,077 --> 02:05:24,741
Hedysarum alpinum is wild potato root.
Wild potato root.

1023
02:05:27,050 --> 02:05:30,645
Epilobium angustifolium. Fireweed.

1024
02:08:26,096 --> 02:08:28,963
Fuck it all. Fuck it all!

1025
02:11:07,424 --> 02:11:08,413
Hi.

1026
02:11:08,525 --> 02:11:11,653
What are you doing up?
It's 3:30 in the morning.

1027
02:11:12,062 --> 02:11:15,225
I heard you get off the couch
about a half hour ago.

1028
02:11:16,533 --> 02:11:20,230
Had a funny feeling
you might not be here for our breakfast.

1029
02:11:24,474 --> 02:11:29,343
I'm gonna drive you 100 miles to
someplace where you can catch a train,

1030
02:11:30,146 --> 02:11:34,810
a plane or hitch a ride
and not get stuck out in this desert.

1031
02:11:36,086 --> 02:11:40,022
I'd take you all the way to Alaska
if I didn't have an 8:00 mass.

1032
02:11:40,423 --> 02:11:43,790
- Ron, you don't have to do that.
- I want to do it.

1033
02:11:44,694 --> 02:11:47,663
Get you started on this thing of yours.

1034
02:11:48,164 --> 02:11:50,155
- On my great...
- I know.

1035
02:11:50,867 --> 02:11:53,358
On your great Alaskan adventure.

1036
02:11:54,204 --> 02:11:56,900
Here. Here's a machete.

1037
02:11:59,276 --> 02:12:04,043
Collapsible fishing pole, a few other
odds and ends I stuck in there for you.

1038
02:12:07,551 --> 02:12:09,951
- Ron...
- Just take it.

1039
02:12:11,354 --> 02:12:14,152
I'll get dressed
and meet you in the truck.

1040
02:13:10,447 --> 02:13:12,039
Well, my friend.

1041
02:13:14,551 --> 02:13:15,575
Yep.

1042
02:13:20,023 --> 02:13:22,491
I had an idea.

1043
02:13:23,627 --> 02:13:28,257
You know, my mother was an only child

1044
02:13:29,199 --> 02:13:30,962
and so was my father,

1045
02:13:31,635 --> 02:13:35,901
and I was their only child,

1046
02:13:39,309 --> 02:13:41,971
so when I'm gone,
I'm the end of the line.

1047
02:13:43,079 --> 02:13:45,138
My family will be finished.

1048
02:13:48,852 --> 02:13:54,154
What do you say you let me adopt you?

1049
02:13:58,561 --> 02:14:02,622
I can be, say, your grandfather.

1050
02:14:07,070 --> 02:14:08,628
Ron,

1051
02:14:10,273 --> 02:14:14,039
could we talk about this
when I get back from Alaska?

1052
02:14:14,444 --> 02:14:16,173
Would that be okay?

1053
02:14:23,520 --> 02:14:26,717
Yeah, yeah. We can do that. Yeah.

1054
02:14:31,695 --> 02:14:32,992
All right, Ron.

1055
02:14:35,398 --> 02:14:36,695
Thank you.

1056
02:15:25,882 --> 02:15:28,043
What did his voice sound like now?

1057
02:15:29,352 --> 02:15:31,513
What would he tell about now?

1058
02:15:32,021 --> 02:15:35,115
Nine, ten.

1059
02:16:24,774 --> 02:16:29,711
I realized that the words to my thoughts
were of less and less meaning.

1060
02:16:29,813 --> 02:16:31,906
Chris was writing his story,

1061
02:16:33,416 --> 02:16:36,385
and it had to be Chris who would tell it.

1062
02:18:57,160 --> 02:18:59,594
"To call each thing by its right name.

1063
02:19:04,500 --> 02:19:06,195
"By its right name."

1064
02:19:57,387 --> 02:19:59,412
What if I were smiling

1065
02:20:01,924 --> 02:20:04,222
and running into your arms?

1066
02:20:26,849 --> 02:20:28,578
Would you see then

1067
02:20:33,756 --> 02:20:35,485
what I see now?
