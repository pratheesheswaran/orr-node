-Can I help you?

00:02:27,910 --> 00:02:31,671
Sir...what about you?

18
00:02:33,432 --> 00:02:34,672
Tony Manero.

19
00:02:35,033 --> 00:02:39,914
Wait a second please.

20
00:02:41,075 --> 00:02:45,236
Right, I'm coming right away.

21
00:02:45,556 --> 00:02:48,758
There is a guy here for next week's contest.

22
00:02:48,758 --> 00:02:51,999
Tony Manero.

23
00:02:52,679 --> 00:02:56,200
Don't worry I'll talk to him.

24
00:02:58,841 --> 00:03:00,522
Hi, excuse me...

25
00:03:02,683 --> 00:03:03,763
How cool!
Your turn is next week.

26
00:03:03,763 --> 00:03:05,804
I was told it was today.

27
00:03:06,124 --> 00:03:07,645
No, its next week.

28
00:03:07,645 --> 00:03:08,645
Oh, its not today?

29
00:03:08,645 --> 00:03:13,367
No, you didn't understand,
we tell people

30
00:03:13,367 --> 00:03:16,928
to come to register a week
in advance...Wait a second please.

31
00:03:16,928 --> 00:03:22,810
-What's wrong with Chuck Norris?
-There's three missing.

32
00:03:22,810 --> 00:03:25,851
No, bring them in, we give them
the instructions, and then go in, OK?

33
00:03:27,012 --> 00:03:29,813
A button has come off.

34
00:03:29,813 --> 00:03:30,773
What?

35
00:03:30,773 --> 00:03:39,736
Under the zipper there are two buttons.
It's well known.

36
00:03:40,097 --> 00:03:43,378
-Enrique!
-Hi.

37
00:03:43,378 --> 00:03:50,140
Attention please! My name is
Juana, I'm the producer of this contest.

38
00:03:50,140 --> 00:03:52,701
And I'm going to give you a couple of tips.
Come in, silence please.

39
00:03:52,701 --> 00:03:57,063
A couple of tips before we
get in the studio OK?

40
00:03:57,063 --> 00:03:58,103
We are going insode through this
part of the stage, very quietly.

41
00:03:58,103 --> 00:04:02,185
Dirty jokes are not allowed,
no government talk,

42
00:04:02,185 --> 00:04:05,306
And no bad words.
Three basic premises.

43
00:04:06,026 --> 00:04:07,107
Whats your name?

44
00:04:07,107 --> 00:04:11,308
Raul Peralta Paredes.

45
00:04:11,548 --> 00:04:15,190
Date of birth?

46
00:04:17,751 --> 00:04:19,911
Your age, sir?

47
00:04:19,911 --> 00:04:22,232
52.

48
00:04:22,912 --> 00:04:25,874
Address?

49
00:04:26,394 --> 00:04:29,315
What for?

50
00:04:29,315 --> 00:04:32,556
Are you from Santiago?

51
00:04:32,556 --> 00:04:35,557
Santiago it is.

52
00:04:35,557 --> 00:04:39,519
Occupation?

53
00:04:39,919 --> 00:04:40,959
This.

54
00:04:40,959 --> 00:04:42,240
This what?

55
00:04:42,600 --> 00:05:57,387
Show business.

56
00:05:57,627 --> 00:05:59,748
-Hello.
-Hello.

57
00:05:59,748 --> 00:07:51,230
It started a half an hour ago...

58
00:08:33,245 --> 00:08:37,607
Thank you, sir.

59
00:08:37,607 --> 00:08:41,688
Fucking boys!
They smashed my kidneys!

60
00:08:45,730 --> 00:08:47,971
Thank you, sir.

61
00:08:50,091 --> 00:08:54,493
I live not so far away.

62
00:08:57,814 --> 00:09:04,096
These people... you know...

63
00:09:04,096 --> 00:09:12,340
come from a bad race.
Thank God there are decent people like you.

64
00:09:23,264 --> 00:09:28,866
Come in sir...

65
00:09:28,866 --> 00:09:33,147
Put the bags over there, please.

66
00:09:42,351 --> 00:09:47,192
This is for you.
The expitation date is last year

67
00:09:47,192 --> 00:09:53,675
but it tastes good.
We like it very much.

68
00:09:55,956 --> 00:09:57,796
It's a color TV.

69
00:09:57,836 --> 00:10:05,879
I've got it because I'm an
Air Force officer's widow.

70
00:10:05,879 --> 00:10:13,882
...the president is about to sign a decree that
declares the Cueca as the national dance...

71
00:10:20,445 --> 00:10:25,046
Look how she pays attention to you.

72
00:10:30,608 --> 00:10:35,890
Did you know that General Pinochet
has blue eyes?

73
00:10:35,890 --> 00:10:37,931
No, I didn't know.

74
00:10:37,931 --> 00:10:44,894
Strange, ah? With so many Mapuches around.

75
00:12:11,806 --> 00:12:17,608
...the runners get to Alameda with a 150 meter
lead over the others...

76
00:13:29,955 --> 00:13:33,716
-Attention there...
-Yes...

77
00:13:34,156 --> 00:13:36,357
To the side...

78
00:13:39,318 --> 00:13:42,720
Up...

79
00:13:43,960 --> 00:13:46,081
To the other side...

80
00:13:48,402 --> 00:13:49,922
Look!

81
00:13:51,363 --> 00:13:53,123
Pauli...

82
00:13:53,123 --> 00:13:53,323
Look at me...

83
00:14:08,689 --> 00:14:11,690
Where were you?

84
00:14:11,690 --> 00:14:15,092
I was waiting for you.

85
00:14:15,092 --> 00:14:20,373
I'm fresh, I very clean.

86
00:14:20,734 --> 00:14:23,935
Polish the boys Raul!

87
00:14:29,217 --> 00:14:35,579
-You're late.
-What?

88
00:14:35,579 --> 00:14:38,700
From the beginning...

89
00:14:40,101 --> 00:14:43,062
Side...

90
00:14:43,062 --> 00:14:48,704
Other side...

91
00:14:49,144 --> 00:14:51,065
Free style...

92
00:14:51,465 --> 00:14:53,146
Leave me alone!

93
00:14:53,306 --> 00:14:56,667
Again...

94
00:14:58,428 --> 00:14:59,908
What happened?

95
00:14:59,908 --> 00:15:02,789
Goyo... you believe
you're the greatest artist...

96
00:15:02,789 --> 00:15:09,272
...No...but he doesn't like this.
He prefers other things,

97
00:15:09,272 --> 00:15:12,833
Different things,

98
00:15:13,353 --> 00:15:16,274
-More profound things like folklore...
-Thats right...

99
00:15:17,154 --> 00:15:18,035
Yes, sure...

100
00:15:18,035 --> 00:15:22,717
How do you call it? "Roots?"
Right Goyo?

101
00:15:22,717 --> 00:15:29,039
Sorry...
right, comrade Goyo?

102
00:15:29,039 --> 00:15:31,640
Whats the problem?
I like both.

103
00:15:31,640 --> 00:15:33,961
We are all together in this!

104
00:15:33,961 --> 00:15:35,321
"All together..."

105
00:15:35,321 --> 00:15:36,442
Shut up you communist!

106
00:15:36,642 --> 00:15:43,204
Here we've come to work.
This is our job.

107
00:15:43,204 --> 00:15:45,885
You have to start doing the show properly,

108
00:15:48,046 --> 00:15:50,567
Professionally.

109
00:15:50,567 --> 00:15:54,328
So the audience comes.

110
00:15:54,328 --> 00:16:00,010
You should go to the movies,
to see Tony.

111
00:16:00,010 --> 00:16:03,892
He knows.

112
00:16:05,172 --> 00:16:10,054
I would like to see Raul in the new suit.

113
00:16:10,054 --> 00:16:12,295
Hasn't he put it on yet?

114
00:16:12,295 --> 00:16:14,416
It would be nice.

115
00:16:14,416 --> 00:16:19,257
Cool!

116
00:16:20,818 --> 00:16:25,660
Put it on, put it on...

117
00:16:27,020 --> 00:16:31,942
I'll wear it on Saturday.

118
00:17:22,201 --> 00:17:23,401
Ouch, what a fall!

119
00:17:23,401 --> 00:17:26,042
Are you OK? These planks are all rotten.

120
00:17:26,042 --> 00:17:28,843
You have to stand up over
there Cony and that's it.

121
00:17:30,164 --> 00:17:33,045
What are you doing Raul?

122
00:17:34,805 --> 00:17:35,726
Stop it!

123
00:17:36,166 --> 00:17:40,888
-You're screwing up my bar!
-But its all rotten!

124
00:17:40,888 --> 00:17:43,369
You are killing my business!

125
00:17:45,089 --> 00:17:47,690
-Stop it, you asshole!
-Let me alone!

126
00:17:48,851 --> 00:17:52,412
We can hardly pay the bills
and you are ruining the floor!

127
00:17:52,852 --> 00:17:56,693
-Stop it!
-Shut up mother fucker!

128
00:17:56,693 --> 00:17:58,374
Its all rotten!

129
00:17:58,374 --> 00:18:03,616
-Give me the jacket!
-Son of a bitch.

130
00:18:03,616 --> 00:18:07,097
You are the bitch.

131
00:18:09,738 --> 00:18:12,099
Fucking floor...

132
00:18:20,862 --> 00:18:23,783
Touch it, touch it.

133
00:18:26,745 --> 00:18:30,946
This is the cathedral-type glass.

134
00:18:32,147 --> 00:18:35,468
And this is the smoked one.

135
00:18:35,468 --> 00:18:39,429
-Besides we have delivery service.
-Really?

136
00:18:39,429 --> 00:18:42,110
Yes, we use that American Ford,
the light blue one.

137
00:18:50,914 --> 00:18:54,555
Are you two together?

138
00:18:55,915 --> 00:18:58,556
Too fat...

139
00:18:58,756 --> 00:19:00,317
What?

140
00:19:03,438 --> 00:19:08,360
It's to dance on. It has to be firm.

141
00:19:13,282 --> 00:19:21,805
You need a high density glass...
Touch it.

142
00:19:23,286 --> 00:19:28,007
How big is the floor?

143
00:20:05,021 --> 00:20:06,942
It would be $74,285.

144
00:20:08,262 --> 00:20:11,623
How much?

145
00:20:11,623 --> 00:20:15,465
$74, 085,
It's an imported product.

146
00:20:17,866 --> 00:20:22,147
I can offer you a better price.

147
00:20:22,307 --> 00:20:26,269
$60,000.
But no delivery.

148
00:20:28,230 --> 00:20:43,475
OK. We might come back later
with the money.

149
00:20:53,919 --> 00:20:57,921
Nice.

150
00:20:57,921 --> 00:20:59,841
...We're back here, at the One O'Clock Show
to share lunch together...

151
00:20:59,841 --> 00:21:00,682
Friends

152
00:21:00,682 --> 00:21:03,563
soon we're going to have
the Chuck Norris final.

153
00:21:03,563 --> 00:21:07,684
"The Double of...Chuck Norris..."

154
00:21:07,684 --> 00:21:11,005
And now I will invite all the disco dancers

155
00:21:11,005 --> 00:21:14,687
Attention to the admirers of

156
00:21:14,687 --> 00:21:16,487
that American dancer...

157
00:21:16,928 --> 00:21:21,809
But what happened?

158
00:21:21,809 --> 00:21:27,732
-Don't take it away.
-Oh, he's going to watch it alone.

159
00:23:20,533 --> 00:23:25,455
It doesn't look good.

160
00:23:25,455 --> 00:23:28,176
It must be the antenna.

161
00:23:52,185 --> 00:23:56,627
What, the floor?

162
00:24:01,508 --> 00:24:04,510
Come over here.

163
00:24:19,835 --> 00:24:22,996
And why do you want that?

164
00:24:24,197 --> 00:24:29,639
To light up from below.

165
00:24:40,083 --> 00:24:44,444
This is what you need.

166
00:24:58,169 --> 00:25:00,450
Whats that?

167
00:25:00,450 --> 00:25:03,811
High densities.

168
00:25:06,933 --> 00:25:11,014
I must have enough for
you to make your floor,

169
00:25:11,014 --> 00:25:16,376
but the TV is not enough.

170
00:25:18,857 --> 00:25:20,978
But...its a color TV.

171
00:25:20,978 --> 00:25:26,860
Yes, but this glass is very expensive.
I'll give you 20 for the TV.

172
00:25:35,663 --> 00:25:43,706
Things cost what they cost
not what you want them to cost.

173
00:25:43,706 --> 00:25:47,308
And I set the price, not you.

174
00:26:34,565 --> 00:26:39,487
Hey kid, watch out!

175
00:26:44,209 --> 00:26:48,970
What are you up to?

176
00:26:50,091 --> 00:26:52,732
I don't like these strange gatherings.

177
00:26:52,732 --> 00:27:00,495
Easy Ms. Wilma, we are moving the
pieces of the new floor.

178
00:27:01,495 --> 00:27:06,057
-What is this for?
-For an effect.

179
00:27:22,183 --> 00:27:24,263
Where is the hair dye?

180
00:27:24,263 --> 00:27:27,585
-Huh?
-The Percolett.

181
00:27:27,585 --> 00:27:31,026
Yes wait. do you want some help?

182
00:27:31,026 --> 00:27:34,907
What for?

183
00:27:40,709 --> 00:27:43,551
The Percolett?

184
00:27:43,551 --> 00:27:46,552
-The Percolett?
-Yes the Percolett.

185
00:27:46,552 --> 00:27:51,393
-It must be in the bedroom.
-Where?

186
00:27:51,674 --> 00:27:53,234
...in the bathroom...

187
00:27:53,234 --> 00:27:56,915
Is it in the bedroom or the bathroom?

188
00:27:56,915 --> 00:27:59,717
I'm not sure. I think I saw it in the bedroom.

189
00:27:59,717 --> 00:28:02,998
Where?

190
00:28:02,998 --> 00:28:03,638
Over there.

191
00:28:03,638 --> 00:28:06,079
In the bedroom?

192
00:28:06,119 --> 00:28:09,400
No, its in the bathroom.

193
00:28:09,680 --> 00:28:13,402
Hey, please come over here...

194
00:28:19,164 --> 00:28:23,605
You look OK.

195
00:28:34,850 --> 00:28:36,930
Probably its in the bathroom.

196
00:30:10,485 --> 00:30:15,927
These people don't think about the future.

197
00:30:16,687 --> 00:30:18,488
What future?

198
00:30:20,969 --> 00:30:25,610
You're future, my future,
their future.

199
00:30:27,051 --> 00:30:28,612
They don't think.

200
00:30:31,133 --> 00:30:36,575
But i know we'll make it
with our dance couple.

201
00:30:53,541 --> 00:30:55,982
But, we have to get out of here.

202
00:30:55,982 --> 00:30:58,223
Why?

203
00:30:58,743 --> 00:31:00,023
Just because.

204
00:31:00,063 --> 00:31:02,184
Just because.

205
00:31:03,505 --> 00:31:06,065
After all Pauli is a grown up now.

206
00:31:07,106 --> 00:31:08,426
She's educated.

207
00:31:10,107 --> 00:31:12,468
However, we have to do it quickly.

208
00:31:12,508 --> 00:31:15,109
-Why?
-Because time is going by,

209
00:31:15,109 --> 00:31:18,910
And the Tony Manero of the movies
is never going to grow old.

210
00:31:18,910 --> 00:31:22,872
But you are getting old.

211
00:31:28,634 --> 00:31:30,675
You are lifeless.

212
00:31:34,716 --> 00:31:37,797
You can't even get a hardon.

213
00:31:37,797 --> 00:31:39,598
It gets swollen, but not hard.

214
00:31:40,718 --> 00:31:44,600
Your glass floor is the only thing
that can turn you on.

215
00:31:46,841 --> 00:31:48,481
You are a fool.

216
00:31:48,481 --> 00:31:52,203
That other one is a Yankee,
You aren't.

217
00:31:53,003 --> 00:31:55,164
You belong here
like the rest of us.

218
00:31:55,164 --> 00:31:57,484
We all live in the same neighborhood.

219
00:31:57,484 --> 00:32:01,486
Not anymore,

220
00:32:02,926 --> 00:32:04,047
What about me?

221
00:32:10,649 --> 00:32:11,770
Tomorrow...

222
00:32:11,810 --> 00:32:15,731
I get my red dress,
like the one in the film.

223
00:32:17,492 --> 00:32:18,452
It's white.

224
00:32:18,492 --> 00:32:18,732
It's white.

225
00:32:19,933 --> 00:32:23,934
It's red, you can see it in the poster.

226
00:32:24,414 --> 00:32:27,976
It isn't white.

227
00:32:31,217 --> 00:32:33,498
Go see the movie again.

228
00:32:35,258 --> 00:32:37,299
And you?
Would you like to go with me?

229
00:32:38,740 --> 00:32:41,301
You are old enough,
go by yourself.

230
00:32:46,903 --> 00:32:49,064
You know what?

231
00:32:50,864 --> 00:32:54,145
You and I are the same thing.

232
00:34:28,300 --> 00:34:31,862
My clothes are ready.

233
00:34:31,862 --> 00:34:35,383
The waist is a little too tight.
But I'm going to fix it.

234
00:34:35,623 --> 00:34:39,104
That's very nice...

235
00:34:42,185 --> 00:34:46,627
It's the same. White suit,

236
00:34:46,627 --> 00:34:50,148
black shirt,

237
00:34:50,949 --> 00:34:53,990
the trousers and the button.

238
00:34:55,070 --> 00:34:59,392
What is it with you?
Did you take your suit for a walk?

239
00:34:59,392 --> 00:35:04,154
What do you mean by "the button?"
There's two buttons.

240
00:35:05,434 --> 00:35:09,275
Its one button.

241
00:35:09,275 --> 00:35:11,156
Two buttons.

242
00:35:11,236 --> 00:35:13,477
One.

243
00:35:14,597 --> 00:35:17,999
I'm telling you there's two buttons.

244
00:35:17,999 --> 00:35:28,643
One is ablove the zipper,
next to the brooch. One.

245
00:35:45,449 --> 00:35:47,209
Beautiful.

246
00:35:51,051 --> 00:35:52,211
Have you tried it on?

247
00:35:52,331 --> 00:35:57,813
There's one button missing,
but it looks the same.

248
00:35:59,494 --> 00:36:03,015
Put it on to see how it looks on you.

249
00:36:03,015 --> 00:36:05,656
You can try it on with the music and everything.

250
00:36:12,499 --> 00:36:16,820
You have to pay for it to the last penny.

251
00:40:02,784 --> 00:40:04,024
Stay there or I'll shoot!

252
00:40:04,545 --> 00:40:05,985
Stay there!

253
00:40:06,665 --> 00:40:08,186
Freeze mother fucker!

254
00:40:08,466 --> 00:40:09,707
Freeze!

255
00:40:09,827 --> 00:40:11,507
Give me that!

256
00:40:13,668 --> 00:40:14,988
What does he have there?

257
00:40:15,109 --> 00:40:16,149
What do you think?

258
00:40:17,309 --> 00:40:18,910
I'm just going home!

259
00:40:18,910 --> 00:40:20,070
You don't have to ask anything!

260
00:40:20,270 --> 00:40:21,871
Where did you get it?

261
00:40:21,871 --> 00:40:23,952
I'm just going home.

262
00:40:23,952 --> 00:40:24,512
What's your name?

263
00:40:24,512 --> 00:40:26,273
-I'm just going home.
-I asked for your name.

264
00:40:26,273 --> 00:40:28,433
José, José...
José is my name.

265
00:40:28,433 --> 00:40:29,794
OK well,
Where do you live?

266
00:40:29,794 --> 00:40:31,475
Here on the other side,
just on the other side.

267
00:40:31,515 --> 00:40:33,795
OK, relax, you're coming with us.

268
00:40:33,795 --> 00:40:35,556
It's part of the procedure.

269
00:40:35,556 --> 00:40:36,636
Where are you living?

270
00:40:36,636 --> 00:40:37,317
Answer me!

271
00:40:37,397 --> 00:40:37,757
Answer me!

272
00:40:37,757 --> 00:40:38,597
Who gave you this?

273
00:40:38,597 --> 00:40:39,838
Shit!

274
00:40:39,918 --> 00:40:40,158
No, no.

275
00:40:40,318 --> 00:40:42,819
-Who is you contact?
-Gregorio.

276
00:40:43,339 --> 00:40:45,520
-What's the skinny guys name?
-Goyo! Goyo!

277
00:41:50,984 --> 00:43:29,020
GET OUT PINOCHET!

278
00:43:29,020 --> 00:43:30,781
Are you going to rehearse?

279
00:43:32,101 --> 00:43:36,223
It's too strange doing the whole rehearsal
without you, because we follow you.

280
00:43:36,743 --> 00:43:40,024
There is no body reference.

281
00:43:40,505 --> 00:43:41,945
But it is entirely possible.

282
00:43:42,305 --> 00:43:44,706
How would it be
possible if he is not in front?

283
00:43:44,706 --> 00:43:48,267
-It's possible.
-It's too difficult.

284
00:43:50,548 --> 00:43:57,871
You know, this part was created by Goyo,
if you want we can take it out.

285
00:43:58,471 --> 00:44:03,633
It would be better if it was just you and me.

286
00:44:03,633 --> 00:44:06,394
What did you say?

287
00:44:06,674 --> 00:44:09,875
-Speak up!
-Nothing...

288
00:44:11,396 --> 00:44:14,517
We should do Raul's choreography.

289
00:44:15,357 --> 00:44:19,719
I mean...Im not sure about
the new steps you created.

290
00:44:20,519 --> 00:44:22,400
You and Raul alone...

291
00:44:23,520 --> 00:44:25,561
Is that what you want?

292
00:44:25,561 --> 00:44:28,922
-Yes, I do.
-what about me, mom?

293
00:44:29,763 --> 00:44:31,083
You and Raul alone...

294
00:44:31,964 --> 00:44:34,004
What about us?
We simply look at you?

295
00:46:44,453 --> 00:46:46,293
Does he speak English?

296
00:46:50,455 --> 00:46:52,456
Look, I've been thinking,

297
00:46:54,896 --> 00:46:57,938
that Tomas, you and me
could leave this place.

298
00:46:59,738 --> 00:47:01,139
Where?

299
00:47:03,540 --> 00:47:04,900
Far away from here.

300
00:47:08,702 --> 00:47:10,982
Without the other two whores.

301
00:47:14,023 --> 00:47:17,105
Because I think you
can see the difference

302
00:47:17,785 --> 00:47:19,586
between me and them.

303
00:47:21,586 --> 00:47:26,348
Don't make that face.

304
00:47:26,348 --> 00:47:27,709
I really love you.

305
00:47:31,030 --> 00:47:35,351
Do you think when you become old
fashioned they will continue to follow you?

306
00:47:38,553 --> 00:47:40,713
No way.

307
00:47:42,034 --> 00:47:43,995
This is not fashion.

308
00:47:50,237 --> 00:47:53,438
Tomas, how many times did i tell you
not to play here with the ball?

309
00:47:53,438 --> 00:47:54,358
Stop it.

310
00:48:12,765 --> 00:48:16,166
Hey, that's the mirror we need
to get ready for the show.

311
00:48:43,256 --> 00:48:45,737
OK, go and help your mother.

312
00:48:45,737 --> 00:48:52,620
On Saturday, I want to see you on
your fucking stage with glass shit.

313
00:48:55,501 --> 00:48:57,102
Pauli...

314
00:48:57,302 --> 00:48:58,982
Oh my God,

315
00:49:00,823 --> 00:49:04,064
Where have you been?

316
00:49:05,465 --> 00:49:08,146
Downtown.

317
00:49:08,266 --> 00:49:10,186
But...how...

318
00:49:10,186 --> 00:49:14,308
I walked here, there weren't any buses.

319
00:49:17,989 --> 00:49:23,111
Goyo is helping people cross the streets.

320
00:49:23,431 --> 00:49:25,512
Everything is flooded.

321
00:49:27,153 --> 00:49:28,833
And the military is doing nothing.

322
00:49:28,833 --> 00:49:30,994
What do you mean
they are doing nothing?

323
00:49:30,994 --> 00:49:33,435
Show some respect.

324
00:49:33,435 --> 00:49:35,716
Now the country is tidy.

325
00:49:35,716 --> 00:49:39,357
Things are working...I'll go
for a bigger towel.

326
00:49:52,722 --> 00:49:53,803
What happened to you?

327
00:49:53,803 --> 00:49:56,203
I came here walking and it is raining.

328
00:49:56,203 --> 00:49:59,445
What are you doing?

329
00:49:59,445 --> 00:50:00,525
Wilma went for a towel.

330
00:50:00,525 --> 00:50:02,806
What are you doing
here naked, you whore!

331
00:50:02,806 --> 00:50:04,887
-But mom...
-Put some clothes on!

332
00:50:06,247 --> 00:50:08,728
Come on, put it on...

333
00:50:14,250 --> 00:50:16,451
Hurry up!

334
00:50:21,333 --> 00:50:24,934
-It looks good on me.
-Go inside!

335
00:50:26,335 --> 00:50:28,055
Go inside!

336
00:50:43,621 --> 00:50:44,581
Fever?

337
00:50:46,502 --> 00:50:48,383
It's not showing.

338
00:50:48,383 --> 00:50:51,904
There's another with the
same gentleman.

339
00:51:07,750 --> 00:51:10,151
No problem, come on in.

340
00:51:10,151 --> 00:51:11,831
Thank you.

341
00:54:30,345 --> 00:54:32,666
Can I use the radio a bit?

342
00:54:33,746 --> 00:54:39,708
Yes.

343
00:54:39,708 --> 00:54:43,710
You know what?

344
00:54:43,710 --> 00:54:45,110
We put together
something to show you.

345
00:54:46,391 --> 00:54:50,112
If you like it you can
add it to the show.

346
00:55:30,687 --> 00:55:34,609
But that's not in the movie.

347
00:55:37,450 --> 00:55:41,251
We would like to cooperate
with the choreography.

348
00:55:41,251 --> 00:55:43,372
What's that?

349
00:55:44,532 --> 00:55:46,253
This is mine.

350
00:56:47,596 --> 00:56:51,957
Hey, is the show with Chilean music?

351
00:56:54,438 --> 00:56:56,199
No, its international.

352
00:56:59,040 --> 00:56:59,960
Want some?

353
00:57:08,723 --> 00:57:12,965
Move it you little shits!

354
00:57:29,811 --> 00:57:31,332
Look, Raul...

355
00:57:33,493 --> 00:57:40,335
This is my capital. The money
you gave me is your capital.

356
00:57:41,456 --> 00:57:45,017
Well...you know, its not easy.

357
00:57:45,537 --> 00:57:53,780
Prices went up, OK? now you are going
to take less glass bricks for the same money.

358
00:57:55,381 --> 00:57:56,621
You can take...

359
00:57:59,262 --> 00:58:03,144
18, and you take them yourself.

360
00:58:04,184 --> 00:58:06,665
Should I open the gate?

361
00:58:52,402 --> 00:58:55,083
You're going to need a lot more bricks.

362
00:59:10,008 --> 00:59:12,209
-Is Goyo outside?
-Yes.

363
00:59:16,251 --> 00:59:19,252
-Did you bring...the potatoes...
-Shut up.

364
00:59:19,252 --> 00:59:20,812
Help us.

365
00:59:21,933 --> 00:59:23,453
Did you get the flyers?

366
00:59:23,493 --> 00:59:24,454
Yeah, I got them!

367
00:59:24,494 --> 00:59:27,135
Stay calm! Stay calm!

368
00:59:28,495 --> 00:59:30,696
Wilma is inside...

369
00:59:31,536 --> 00:59:32,977
I saw her...

370
00:59:45,702 --> 00:59:47,782
And are you still at it?

371
00:59:49,543 --> 00:59:51,424
What do you have over there?

372
00:59:51,424 --> 00:59:53,704
-Potatoes.
-I told you to bring onions.

373
00:59:53,704 --> 00:59:55,305
I brought potatoes anyway.

374
00:59:55,305 --> 00:59:56,746
What are you up to?

375
00:59:57,026 --> 00:59:58,146
Helping.

376
01:00:00,307 --> 01:00:02,388
I know exactly what you've got yourself
involved in.

377
01:00:02,388 --> 01:00:03,428
I'm not like Wilma.

378
01:00:03,428 --> 01:00:06,109
How many times did I tell you
not to get into that shit?

379
01:00:06,109 --> 01:00:06,949
How many?

380
01:00:06,949 --> 01:00:08,350
Don't get the wrong idea , mom.

381
01:00:14,872 --> 01:00:19,034
Stop putting ideas into
my daughter's head.

382
01:00:19,034 --> 01:00:22,395
She's a grownup.
She's where she has to be.

383
01:00:23,275 --> 01:00:25,836
Yeah, sure.

384
01:00:25,836 --> 01:00:26,877
What's going on?

385
01:00:26,877 --> 01:00:27,877
Nothing...

386
01:01:03,210 --> 01:01:05,891
Hey, do you have a few bones?

387
01:01:08,652 --> 01:01:09,533
Look...

388
01:01:15,695 --> 01:01:18,896
-I have a Seiko myself.
-Yes, but this is a new one.

389
01:04:02,517 --> 01:04:04,197
Why are you dressed like that?

390
01:04:04,877 --> 01:04:06,958
Play the B side.

391
01:04:07,999 --> 01:04:10,239
It says 1 and 2.

392
01:04:11,480 --> 01:04:13,561
2 is B.

393
01:04:16,202 --> 01:04:17,922
And the white suit?

394
01:04:17,922 --> 01:04:19,363
None of your business.

395
01:04:19,363 --> 01:04:21,884
Weren't you supposed
to wear it tonight?

396
01:04:21,884 --> 01:04:25,245
It was missing a button.

397
01:04:25,245 --> 01:04:28,646
Hurry up everybody,
we're almost ready.

398
01:04:29,006 --> 01:04:33,448
We'll go up on stage and
we'll dance like we've never danced before.

399
01:04:33,688 --> 01:04:35,609
Together, like a family, united.

400
01:04:37,369 --> 01:04:45,292
Today life is giving us a chance.
A chance to...

401
01:04:45,292 --> 01:04:48,093
Shut up Goyo!
You sound like a preacher.

402
01:04:48,093 --> 01:04:54,536
Here's our national Tony Manero
and his dance group.

403
01:04:59,217 --> 01:05:01,138
It's crowded!

404
01:05:01,738 --> 01:05:04,259
It's full of people!

405
01:07:02,503 --> 01:07:06,064
There wasn't enough
fish for everybody.

406
01:07:06,545 --> 01:07:08,945
And there wont be enough wine
for those two.

407
01:07:09,346 --> 01:07:14,868
Stop drinkning and start cleaning up!

408
01:07:14,868 --> 01:07:17,269
You drank it all!

409
01:07:17,309 --> 01:07:19,229
Leave me alone.

410
01:07:19,229 --> 01:07:24,631
Sir, there's half an hour until curfew,
so we are done.

411
01:07:24,631 --> 01:07:28,833
Don't curfew me.

412
01:07:28,833 --> 01:07:30,513
Time to go home.

413
01:07:31,074 --> 01:07:35,275
The army is acting wild,
so you better get home.

414
01:07:37,836 --> 01:07:39,837
Don't you want to eat something?

415
01:07:39,837 --> 01:07:42,918
No, only Fanta.

416
01:07:44,679 --> 01:07:46,439
What are you looking at?

417
01:07:47,560 --> 01:07:51,241
A bird that shits in the nest
is a bad bird.

418
01:10:31,540 --> 01:10:32,821
Raul...

419
01:11:09,795 --> 01:11:12,155
Don't get dizzy sweetheart.

420
01:11:17,077 --> 01:11:19,118
Come with me.

421
01:11:24,240 --> 01:11:26,281
It's alright.

422
01:14:45,834 --> 01:14:47,835
Did you have a good sleep?

423
01:15:00,280 --> 01:15:04,121
You're going to end up shitting a bastard.

424
01:15:06,042 --> 01:15:07,442
Come with me.

425
01:15:49,498 --> 01:15:51,939
Did you have fun last night?

426
01:16:33,034 --> 01:16:35,955
What made you decide
to have a bath?

427
01:16:45,279 --> 01:16:48,200
Goyo tell us!

428
01:16:49,200 --> 01:16:52,361
-What?
-Ask Goyo to tell us...

429
01:16:53,922 --> 01:16:55,282
What?

430
01:16:55,402 --> 01:16:57,403
Nothing. My business.

431
01:16:57,403 --> 01:17:00,124
Tell us.

432
01:17:01,885 --> 01:17:04,486
Come on. Tell everyone.

433
01:17:04,486 --> 01:17:05,246
What's the secret?

434
01:17:07,087 --> 01:17:08,687
I'm going to the TV station.

435
01:17:08,687 --> 01:17:12,049
To the TV station?

436
01:17:12,049 --> 01:17:12,569
Yes, to the TV station.

437
01:17:12,569 --> 01:17:14,770
He's going to be on the One O'Clock Show.

438
01:17:14,770 --> 01:17:19,731
They are looking for the Chilean Tony Manero.

439
01:17:20,212 --> 01:17:22,933
I have the white suit and everything.

440
01:17:22,973 --> 01:17:25,173
Just like Raul's?

441
01:17:25,173 --> 01:17:27,414
-But mine.
-Can you imagine?

442
01:17:27,414 --> 01:17:29,655
When are you going?

443
01:17:29,655 --> 01:17:32,536
-Today.
-Today?

444
01:17:32,536 --> 01:17:36,818
Raul should go too.
We'll have a better chance to win.

445
01:17:37,098 --> 01:17:39,939
You're right. You're the winner.

446
01:17:39,939 --> 01:17:42,500
He's too young to win.

447
01:17:43,180 --> 01:17:45,661
Plus, he's too dark.

448
01:17:46,501 --> 01:17:48,622
And he has brown eyes.

449
01:17:52,463 --> 01:17:55,865
You are clumsy on your birthday.

450
01:17:55,865 --> 01:17:58,626
No cake for you!

451
01:17:59,426 --> 01:18:01,867
It was an accident...

452
01:20:25,000 --> 01:20:27,121
Pay attention!

453
01:20:28,161 --> 01:20:30,802
Calling Paulina Garces Garces?

454
01:20:33,363 --> 01:20:36,044
Miss Paulina Garces Garces!

455
01:20:37,725 --> 01:20:41,086
That's me. What do you need me for?

456
01:20:42,126 --> 01:20:42,246
OK.

457
01:20:42,246 --> 01:20:44,047
Sit down.

458
01:20:46,168 --> 01:20:48,569
Come together everyone.

459
01:20:48,609 --> 01:20:51,250
We need to discuss something important.

460
01:20:52,490 --> 01:20:53,891
OK, everybody out.

461
01:20:54,651 --> 01:20:57,372
You...get over here.
We have to talk.

462
01:20:59,533 --> 01:21:00,853
Cony.

463
01:21:01,693 --> 01:21:03,614
Here, sit next to me.

464
01:21:04,535 --> 01:21:06,855
Did you hear me motherfuckers?

465
01:21:06,895 --> 01:21:08,416
Raul! You're an asshole!

466
01:21:08,416 --> 01:21:09,776
Let's get out of here!

467
01:21:19,700 --> 01:21:21,141
Raul! You're an asshole!

468
01:21:21,301 --> 01:21:22,421
Raul!

469
01:21:23,822 --> 01:21:26,943
Where is he?

470
01:21:26,943 --> 01:21:27,223
No idea.

471
01:21:27,223 --> 01:21:28,824
What do you mean?
Where's Raul?

472
01:21:29,224 --> 01:21:31,304
Sit down!

473
01:21:33,665 --> 01:21:35,386
What's the matter?

474
01:21:35,426 --> 01:21:36,746
What do you mean what's the matter?

475
01:21:37,267 --> 01:21:38,987
I told you to sit down jerk!

476
01:21:41,308 --> 01:21:42,589
Hey Cony.

477
01:21:42,589 --> 01:21:43,629
Who is this guy?

478
01:21:45,910 --> 01:21:47,390
Why don't you ask me?

479
01:21:48,951 --> 01:21:51,752
Shut up punk! Stay cool.

480
01:21:58,074 --> 01:22:00,355
Who's Raul?

481
01:22:03,796 --> 01:22:05,717
Who else lives here?

482
01:22:05,757 --> 01:22:09,999
No, no. Sometimes he comes.

483
01:22:09,999 --> 01:22:12,400
Marcelo, go upstairs.

484
01:22:15,041 --> 01:22:16,521
What's the matter?

485
01:22:16,561 --> 01:22:19,282
We were told
strange things happen in this place.

486
01:22:19,522 --> 01:22:20,923
People talk.

487
01:22:21,883 --> 01:22:25,524
I haven't done anything wrong.

488
01:22:25,524 --> 01:22:26,805
-Oh really?
-Really.

489
01:22:26,805 --> 01:22:28,606
Nothing wrong...

490
01:22:31,167 --> 01:22:32,687
Ask your mom.

491
01:22:37,169 --> 01:22:40,530
This is your daughter, right?

492
01:22:44,171 --> 01:22:48,053
You can't change your mind now.

493
01:22:50,534 --> 01:22:52,494
Is this your daughter or not?

494
01:22:57,136 --> 01:23:00,017
Yes.

495
01:23:00,017 --> 01:23:01,018
Goyo, say something.

496
01:23:06,380 --> 01:23:08,340
Tell him.

497
01:23:09,021 --> 01:23:11,582
You said it was safe.

498
01:23:13,542 --> 01:23:14,743
Say something.

499
01:23:16,263 --> 01:23:17,104
What's your name?

500
01:23:17,424 --> 01:23:19,344
Gregorio Salinas.

501
01:23:19,705 --> 01:23:20,865

Sir, come with me please.

01:25:54,122 --> 01:26:02,205
As you said earlier, we shouldn't be fighting
over a piece of land.

537
01:26:02,205 --> 01:26:07,767
-It's not worth it.
