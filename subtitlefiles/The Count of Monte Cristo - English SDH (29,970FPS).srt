1
00:01:47,587 --> 00:01:49,851
Idiots.

2
00:01:53,593 --> 00:01:57,689
Take the captain beyond the reef
till we get permission
to bring him ashore.

3
00:02:00,133 --> 00:02:02,624
For a moment I thought
you were abandoning me.

4
00:02:02,702 --> 00:02:07,105
Fernand Mondego does not
abandon his friends in the face
of stupid, suicidal danger.

5
00:02:07,174 --> 00:02:11,907
However, as Monsieur Morell's
official representative
on this voyage, Edmond,

6
00:02:11,978 --> 00:02:15,038
I must officially tell you
you have overstepped
your bounds as second mate.

7
00:02:15,115 --> 00:02:17,777
Officially. There.
I've covered myself.

8
00:02:17,851 --> 00:02:20,479
If we don't get him to
a doctor, he will die.
Do you understand?

9
00:02:20,554 --> 00:02:23,489
Of course I understand.
Just don't expect me
to do this sober.

10
00:02:23,557 --> 00:02:25,491
- [Horse Whinnies]
- Right.

11
00:02:25,559 --> 00:02:28,824
[Fernand]
English dragoons.

12
00:02:28,895 --> 00:02:30,658
Hello!

13
00:02:32,532 --> 00:02:35,000
Dantes, don't.

14
00:02:36,036 --> 00:02:37,867
[Whinnying]

15
00:02:37,938 --> 00:02:39,997
- A little careless,
don't you think?
- We have to talk to someone.

16
00:02:40,073 --> 00:02:42,633
Well, I know, but...

17
00:02:42,709 --> 00:02:44,074
We're French sailors!

18
00:02:44,144 --> 00:02:46,612
- We seek medical attention!
- Come on. Come on.

19
00:02:47,481 --> 00:02:50,245
- We come in peace.
- Come on.

20
00:02:50,917 --> 00:02:52,544
We mean no harm!

21
00:02:52,619 --> 00:02:54,553
Edmond!

22
00:02:59,559 --> 00:03:02,392
Come on! Climb!

23
00:03:12,506 --> 00:03:14,531
Look out!

24
00:03:38,098 --> 00:03:39,725
Fernand!

25
00:03:44,804 --> 00:03:48,240
Good. You finally
hit something.

26
00:03:53,346 --> 00:03:55,871
Lieutenant Graypool.

27
00:03:55,949 --> 00:03:58,577
If your thirst for gore demands
the death of these poor fools,

28
00:03:58,652 --> 00:04:00,813
then by all means
shoot them.

29
00:04:00,887 --> 00:04:03,879
But do so with the knowledge
they are no agents of mine.

30
00:04:03,957 --> 00:04:06,118
Now explain yourselves
or be shot.

31
00:04:06,192 --> 00:04:09,855
Sir, I am Edmond Dantes,

32
00:04:09,930 --> 00:04:13,627
second mate of the merchant ship
Pharaon, on our way home to Marseilles.

33
00:04:13,700 --> 00:04:18,763
This is the shipowner's representative,
Monsieur Fernand Mondego,

34
00:04:18,838 --> 00:04:21,500
son of the Count Mondego.

35
00:04:21,575 --> 00:04:25,136
Our captain has
contracted brain fever,
so we put in here for help.

36
00:04:28,281 --> 00:04:32,980
If his coma is genuine,
he won't feel my knife point,
will he?

37
00:04:35,522 --> 00:04:38,320
Only a scratch.

38
00:04:43,330 --> 00:04:45,264
[Flesh Cutting]

39
00:04:46,700 --> 00:04:48,258
Edmond!

40
00:04:48,335 --> 00:04:50,826
- Lieutenant Graypool!
- We came to you in good faith!

41
00:04:50,904 --> 00:04:55,466
- That's for my wounded men.
- And wounded pride, no doubt.

42
00:05:03,617 --> 00:05:07,212
It has been an eventful evening.

43
00:05:16,529 --> 00:05:21,296
If I hadn't have shot those
dragoons, you might by lying in
pieces on the beach right now.

44
00:05:21,368 --> 00:05:25,702
- I almost got us killed.
- Yes, you did.

45
00:05:25,772 --> 00:05:29,071
Yet... we survive.

46
00:05:29,142 --> 00:05:32,339
Donne-moi encore
une bouteille du vin

47
00:05:32,412 --> 00:05:34,346
- Whoo-hoo!
- [Laughs]

48
00:05:34,414 --> 00:05:38,851
Donne-moi encore
une bouteille du vin

49
00:05:38,918 --> 00:05:41,148
King's to you, Mondego.

50
00:05:41,221 --> 00:05:44,816
Being your friend
is always an adventure. [Laughs]

51
00:05:44,891 --> 00:05:48,327
- Yes, it is, isn't it?
- [Laughs]

52
00:05:48,395 --> 00:05:50,659
It's a pity adventurers can't always
be friends though, huh?

53
00:05:50,730 --> 00:05:52,254
What?

54
00:05:52,332 --> 00:05:55,597
Well, it won't always
be like this, will it?

55
00:05:55,669 --> 00:05:59,935
- What are you talking about?
- Nothing. Drink up.

56
00:06:00,006 --> 00:06:03,908
We're drinking
Napoleon Bonaparte's wine.

57
00:06:03,977 --> 00:06:06,844
[Napoleon] I think you'll find
the 1806 the finer vintage.

58
00:06:06,913 --> 00:06:10,815
As long as you're still awake,
Monsieur Dantes, I wonder...

59
00:06:10,884 --> 00:06:13,250
if I might have
a word with you.

60
00:06:15,555 --> 00:06:19,889
I'm curious. What's the significance
of the chess piece?

61
00:06:20,093 --> 00:06:24,029
It's just something
we've done since childhood.

62
00:06:24,097 --> 00:06:28,397
Whenever one of us has had a victory,
king of the moment.

63
00:06:28,468 --> 00:06:30,698
- King of the moment?
- Yes.

64
00:06:30,770 --> 00:06:35,673
[Chuckles] In life, we're all
either kings or pawns.

65
00:06:35,742 --> 00:06:40,111
I'm moved by your effort to save
your captain's life, Dantes.

66
00:06:40,180 --> 00:06:43,616
He is my captain...
and my friend, Your Majesty.

67
00:06:43,683 --> 00:06:46,049
Loyal friends
are rare indeed.

68
00:06:46,119 --> 00:06:49,714
In fact, it is upon such
a matter I wish to speak.

69
00:06:49,789 --> 00:06:53,953
I have written a rather
sentimental letter to an
old comrade in Marseilles.

70
00:06:54,027 --> 00:06:56,621
It's a side of me I prefer
the British not see.

71
00:06:56,696 --> 00:06:59,688
Since they have a habit
of opening my mail,

72
00:06:59,766 --> 00:07:03,600
I wonder if you would
deliver it for me.

73
00:07:03,670 --> 00:07:05,831
Oh, l-I don't...

74
00:07:05,905 --> 00:07:08,840
It's just a letter
from one old soldier to another.

75
00:07:08,908 --> 00:07:11,775
It's totally innocent,
I assure you.

76
00:07:11,845 --> 00:07:15,303
But more important,
it is the price I demand
for the use of my physician.

77
00:07:19,252 --> 00:07:21,243
Then I agree.

78
00:07:21,321 --> 00:07:23,255
Good.

79
00:07:23,323 --> 00:07:26,520
You are to deliver the letter
to Monsieur Clarion.

80
00:07:26,593 --> 00:07:30,859
- Can you remember that name?
- Monsieur Clarion.
How will I find him?

81
00:07:30,930 --> 00:07:33,865
Oh, he will find you.

82
00:07:33,933 --> 00:07:37,699
Now, I do not wish
this letter's existence
to be known to anyone else.

83
00:07:37,771 --> 00:07:41,070
Not even your boon companion back there.
Do you understand?

84
00:07:41,141 --> 00:07:43,473
I'm a man of my word,
Your Majesty.

85
00:07:43,543 --> 00:07:47,274
Yes, I, uh...
I believe you are.

86
00:08:02,729 --> 00:08:04,663
What did he want?

87
00:08:04,731 --> 00:08:09,794
Oh, um, news from France.
That's all.

88
00:08:29,355 --> 00:08:33,348
Time you were on your way.
Your captain has been dead
for half an hour.

89
00:08:37,430 --> 00:08:39,364
Are you sure?

90
00:08:39,432 --> 00:08:43,061
When you have walked
as many battlefields as I,
young Dantes,

91
00:08:43,136 --> 00:08:45,070
you can feel death.

92
00:08:50,844 --> 00:08:53,278
Kings and pawns, Marchand.

93
00:08:53,346 --> 00:08:57,783
Emperors... and fools.

94
00:09:09,996 --> 00:09:12,931
[Chattering]

95
00:09:12,999 --> 00:09:16,264
[Man]
Come about!

96
00:09:22,842 --> 00:09:24,810
Drive faster.

97
00:09:33,620 --> 00:09:36,487
[Bell Chiming]

98
00:09:40,026 --> 00:09:42,290
Danglars, what's happened?

99
00:09:42,362 --> 00:09:45,763
Captain Reynaud is dead, sir,

100
00:09:45,832 --> 00:09:48,232
and Edmond Dantes
disobeyed my orders.

101
00:09:48,301 --> 00:09:52,135
Come to my office
and report, Danglars.

102
00:09:52,305 --> 00:09:56,071
- And you, Edmond.
- Will you be needing me,
Monsieur Morell?

103
00:09:56,142 --> 00:09:57,302
Go.

104
00:10:01,981 --> 00:10:04,142
Mercedes.

105
00:10:04,217 --> 00:10:09,154
- Where is he? Where is Edmond?
- How lovely to see you too.

106
00:10:09,222 --> 00:10:11,417
You just missed him,
I'm afraid.

107
00:10:11,491 --> 00:10:14,085
Could be a while.
I think he's in trouble.

108
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:16,185
He said he'd meet us
by the rock. Come on.

109
00:10:16,262 --> 00:10:18,287
I told Dantes
not to go ashore.

110
00:10:18,364 --> 00:10:20,628
Is this true?

111
00:10:20,700 --> 00:10:23,100
I accept
all responsibility.

112
00:10:23,169 --> 00:10:26,627
As well you should.
It was all his idea, monsieur.

113
00:10:26,706 --> 00:10:30,472
It should have
been your idea.

114
00:10:30,543 --> 00:10:33,979
Puttin' into Elba didn't save
the captain's life, monsieur.

115
00:10:34,047 --> 00:10:37,210
- I was protectin'the merchandise.
- You were protecting yourself...

116
00:10:37,283 --> 00:10:41,083
by hiding behind your rank
and staying aboard.

117
00:10:41,154 --> 00:10:46,683
Edmond Dantes, I am making you
the new captain of the Pharaon.

118
00:10:49,629 --> 00:10:52,894
You presume to demote me?

119
00:10:52,966 --> 00:10:54,900
There is no demotion.

120
00:10:54,968 --> 00:10:59,064
You will remain first mate
under Captain Dantes.

121
00:10:59,138 --> 00:11:02,505
Unless, of course, you choose
to seek another berth.

122
00:11:13,086 --> 00:11:16,180
Now I imagine there's
a certain young lady...

123
00:11:16,255 --> 00:11:19,554
who will want
to hear this news.

124
00:11:23,629 --> 00:11:26,029
- [Chuckles]
- Thank you.

125
00:11:33,906 --> 00:11:36,374
Monsieur Morell?

126
00:11:36,442 --> 00:11:41,880
- I understand you had a ship just
returned from Elba, monsieur.
- Yes.

127
00:11:41,948 --> 00:11:46,681
Did anyone aboard
get ashore there by any chance?

128
00:11:46,753 --> 00:11:50,348
They did, but they're
not here at the moment.

129
00:11:51,424 --> 00:11:53,517
Thank you, monsieur.

130
00:11:53,593 --> 00:11:56,255
- May I say who has called upon them?
- Clarion.

131
00:11:56,329 --> 00:11:59,093
The name is Clarion.

132
00:12:05,004 --> 00:12:08,633
- Make love to me.
- Will you ever give up?

133
00:12:08,708 --> 00:12:11,199
- He doesn't have to know.
- I'd know.

134
00:12:11,277 --> 00:12:13,677
So would I.

135
00:12:13,746 --> 00:12:17,546
- It'd be our little secret.
- I don't believe in secrets.

136
00:12:17,617 --> 00:12:22,452
You think Edmond doesn't have secrets?
He does. Ask him.

137
00:12:22,522 --> 00:12:25,787
- I know what you want, Fernand.
- You do?

138
00:12:25,858 --> 00:12:30,591
Remember when we were kids and
Edmond got that whistle for his
birthday, and you got a pony?

139
00:12:30,663 --> 00:12:34,463
You were so mad Edmond
was happier with his whistle
than you were with your pony.

140
00:12:34,534 --> 00:12:38,300
I'm not going to be
your next whistle.

141
00:12:41,174 --> 00:12:44,166
How long do you think
it's going to be before
he can afford a wife?

142
00:12:44,243 --> 00:12:48,304
Two years.
Two years. That's all.

143
00:12:48,381 --> 00:12:51,373
Then he gets his captain's
papers, and we can marry.

144
00:12:51,451 --> 00:12:55,444
Two years. I couldn't wait
two years for anything,

145
00:12:55,521 --> 00:12:57,751
particularly
a bride like you.

146
00:12:59,425 --> 00:13:00,915
Hey!

147
00:13:00,993 --> 00:13:03,154
- [Mercedes] There he is.
- Hey!

148
00:13:03,229 --> 00:13:05,424
- [Laughs] Whoo!
- Mercedes!

149
00:13:11,337 --> 00:13:14,670
[Mercedes]
I missed you so.

150
00:13:14,740 --> 00:13:17,106
The missing is over now.

151
00:13:17,176 --> 00:13:21,135
- Are you in trouble?
- No. I'm captain. Come on.

152
00:13:25,251 --> 00:13:28,448
Monsieur Morell
gave me the Pharaon.

153
00:13:28,521 --> 00:13:31,115
Edmond!

154
00:13:31,190 --> 00:13:33,283
King's to me.

155
00:13:33,359 --> 00:13:38,387
[Chuckles] Yours is a life
truly blessed, Edmond.

156
00:13:39,932 --> 00:13:42,196
[Clicks Tongue]

157
00:13:43,803 --> 00:13:45,065
Come on.

158
00:13:45,138 --> 00:13:48,301
- You're still the best man.
- I know.

159
00:13:48,374 --> 00:13:50,467
Come on!

160
00:14:18,905 --> 00:14:22,238
Stop that.
You'll go bald.

161
00:14:28,347 --> 00:14:30,440
Do you keep secrets from me?

162
00:14:30,516 --> 00:14:34,509
Secrets? No.

163
00:14:34,587 --> 00:14:36,521
Why?

164
00:14:41,060 --> 00:14:43,255
Ask me anything
and I'll tell you.

165
00:14:47,700 --> 00:14:50,533
We don't have to wait
two years anymore.

166
00:14:50,603 --> 00:14:56,132
- As soon as I can afford
the ring, we'll wed...
- I don't need a ring. I don't.

167
00:15:03,816 --> 00:15:05,750
This will be my ring.

168
00:15:05,818 --> 00:15:09,845
And no matter what happens,

169
00:15:09,922 --> 00:15:14,256
you will never see it
off my finger.

170
00:15:14,327 --> 00:15:16,295
Ever.

171
00:15:26,472 --> 00:15:30,568
[Danglars]
Hello, my fine young gentleman.

172
00:15:30,643 --> 00:15:32,668
Care to join me?

173
00:15:37,750 --> 00:15:40,412
So tell me, Mondego,

174
00:15:42,622 --> 00:15:45,853
how did you ever
become friends...

175
00:15:45,925 --> 00:15:49,122
with that righteous little ponce,
Edmond Dantes?

176
00:15:51,330 --> 00:15:54,094
He claims to be my friend,

177
00:15:55,835 --> 00:15:58,827
yet he has the audacity
to keep secrets from me.

178
00:15:58,904 --> 00:16:01,270
What secrets?

179
00:16:14,420 --> 00:16:17,480
[Tapping]

180
00:16:17,556 --> 00:16:22,050
To the new captain
of the Pharaon.

181
00:16:23,329 --> 00:16:27,288
All I am I owe
to you, Father.

182
00:16:28,601 --> 00:16:32,537
May this happy moment
be but the dawn...

183
00:16:32,605 --> 00:16:37,474
of a long and wonderful life
for you both.

184
00:16:37,543 --> 00:16:39,477
[Door Opens]

185
00:16:39,545 --> 00:16:44,141
- Which of you is Edmond Dantes?
- I am.

186
00:16:44,216 --> 00:16:47,379
Edmond Dantes,
you are under arrest by order
of the magistrate of Marseilles.

187
00:16:47,453 --> 00:16:49,683
- Arrest?
- On what charges?

188
00:16:49,755 --> 00:16:52,519
That information is
privileged. Take him.

189
00:16:52,591 --> 00:16:57,085
I demand an explanation.
I demand an explanation!

190
00:16:57,163 --> 00:17:01,259
I'll be back tonight.
Don't worry, Father. This is a mistake.

191
00:17:01,334 --> 00:17:03,564
Mon Dieu.

192
00:17:16,082 --> 00:17:18,778
Well, I must say, Dantes,
you don't have the look of a traitor.

193
00:17:20,052 --> 00:17:22,179
Traitor?

194
00:17:22,254 --> 00:17:25,781
Now, attend me well, Dantes,
for your life may depend on it.

195
00:17:25,858 --> 00:17:29,385
Did you have any personal
contact with Napoleon
when you were on Elba?

196
00:17:29,462 --> 00:17:31,692
Elba, yes, I did.
Well, we did.

197
00:17:31,764 --> 00:17:36,531
I was with the
Count Mondego's son, Fernand,
almost the entire time.

198
00:17:36,602 --> 00:17:39,935
- Do you know Fernand?
- He's a recent acquaintance, yes.

199
00:17:40,005 --> 00:17:44,101
Oh, there you are.
He'll vouch for me.

200
00:17:44,176 --> 00:17:46,736
No doubt, but you said,
"almost the entire time."

201
00:17:49,548 --> 00:17:54,952
Except for when Napoleon asked
me to deliver a personal letter
to a friend in Marseilles.

202
00:17:55,020 --> 00:17:59,047
Well, Dantes, it is for
accepting that treasonous
correspondence...

203
00:17:59,125 --> 00:18:02,959
that you have been denounced
by your own first mate,
a Monsieur Danglars.

204
00:18:03,028 --> 00:18:05,792
- What?
- Did you deliver the letter?

205
00:18:05,865 --> 00:18:08,561
No, sir, someone was
supposed to find me.

206
00:18:08,634 --> 00:18:11,762
It's... It's still
in my jacket. Here.

207
00:18:30,890 --> 00:18:35,190
- Have you read this?
- No, sir, I can't read.

208
00:18:35,261 --> 00:18:40,164
Well, Dantes,
this is a letter to one
of Napoleon's agents.

209
00:18:40,232 --> 00:18:44,999
It gives the times and
the locations of the British
beach patrols on Elba.

210
00:18:45,070 --> 00:18:48,767
Sir, I swear on my mother's
grave, I had no idea.

211
00:18:48,841 --> 00:18:50,809
He swore its contents
were innocent.

212
00:18:57,917 --> 00:19:02,980
No, it's you
that's innocent.

213
00:19:03,055 --> 00:19:05,649
Foolish and innocent.

214
00:19:05,724 --> 00:19:09,353
I believe these are
the worst charges that could
be leveled against you.

215
00:19:09,428 --> 00:19:15,025
Fortunately, as I've
intercepted this document,
there's no harm done.

216
00:19:15,100 --> 00:19:18,467
God knows how
you're going to survive in
this world, Edmond Dantes.

217
00:19:18,537 --> 00:19:21,472
But you are no traitor.

218
00:19:21,540 --> 00:19:24,134
You may go.

219
00:19:26,579 --> 00:19:28,604
Thank you, sir.

220
00:19:30,883 --> 00:19:36,344
Wait, uh, did Napoleon
tell you who's supposed
to pick up the letter?

221
00:19:36,422 --> 00:19:38,583
Monsieur Clarion.

222
00:19:38,657 --> 00:19:40,648
What name did you say?

223
00:19:42,828 --> 00:19:44,762
Monsieur Clarion.

224
00:19:46,165 --> 00:19:48,395
Have you mentioned
this name to anyone else?

225
00:19:48,467 --> 00:19:50,697
Monsieur Mondego
or anyone?

226
00:19:50,769 --> 00:19:55,968
No, sir, in fact,
Monsieur Mondego knows
nothing of this letter.

227
00:20:00,946 --> 00:20:05,883
This is very
dangerous information.

228
00:20:05,951 --> 00:20:08,920
One can never be too careful
in times like this.

229
00:20:08,988 --> 00:20:12,048
- Don't you think?
- Yes, sir.

230
00:20:12,124 --> 00:20:14,524
Mm-hmm.

231
00:20:14,593 --> 00:20:18,120
I've given you rather
a stressful time.

232
00:20:18,197 --> 00:20:21,997
I wonder if, by way of an
apology, I could offer you
my carriage home.

233
00:20:22,067 --> 00:20:24,865
- [Door Closes]
- It's just through here.

234
00:20:29,608 --> 00:20:31,906
[Hoofbeats, Carriage
Approaching]

235
00:20:31,977 --> 00:20:34,138
Thank you.

236
00:20:51,664 --> 00:20:55,065
Monsieur Villefort?
Monsieur Villefort?

237
00:20:55,134 --> 00:20:57,329
Monsieur Villefort!

238
00:21:18,891 --> 00:21:20,859
Whoa. Whoa!

239
00:21:24,763 --> 00:21:27,527
Where are you taking me?

240
00:21:28,701 --> 00:21:30,999
[Edmond]
This is a mistake.

241
00:21:31,070 --> 00:21:34,836
- I'm allowed to go home.
- From now on, your home is
the prison Chateau d'lf.

242
00:21:34,907 --> 00:21:37,842
- No! No! No!
- [Gasps]

243
00:21:37,910 --> 00:21:40,105
- [Groans]
- Hey!

244
00:21:46,619 --> 00:21:50,248
[Man]
Shoot him now!

245
00:21:50,322 --> 00:21:53,655
Mount up!
Get after him!

246
00:22:09,942 --> 00:22:14,504
Fernand! Fernand!

247
00:22:14,580 --> 00:22:17,572
- Monsieur?
- It's all right.
He's right here. Fernand!

248
00:22:17,650 --> 00:22:21,518
I've been arrested for treason.
I barely managed to escape.

249
00:22:21,587 --> 00:22:24,215
When we were on Elba,
Napoleon gave me a letter.

250
00:22:24,289 --> 00:22:26,917
I didn't tell you because
he made me promise not to.

251
00:22:26,992 --> 00:22:28,926
He said it was just
some note to an old friend.

252
00:22:28,994 --> 00:22:31,519
But the bastard lied to me!
He lied.

253
00:22:31,597 --> 00:22:34,157
It was to one of his agents.

254
00:22:34,233 --> 00:22:37,134
Somehow the authorities found out.
I don't know what to do.

255
00:22:37,202 --> 00:22:39,193
There's gendarmes on
horseback right behind me.

256
00:22:39,271 --> 00:22:42,434
All right.
We just have to think.

257
00:22:42,508 --> 00:22:44,442
I hope I haven't
compromised you.

258
00:22:44,510 --> 00:22:46,535
I was hoping your father
could help me.

259
00:22:46,612 --> 00:22:48,910
He's in Paris.
He's very ill.

260
00:22:48,981 --> 00:22:51,950
- How far back are the gendarmes?
- Minutes.

261
00:22:52,017 --> 00:22:54,577
- Do you need money?
- Yes, thank you.

262
00:22:54,653 --> 00:22:57,213
- Do you have a pistol?
- Of course not.

263
00:22:57,289 --> 00:22:59,348
Good.

264
00:22:59,425 --> 00:23:02,917
Stop it, Fernand.
I don't have time for this.

265
00:23:07,032 --> 00:23:09,626
I saw Napoleon
give you that letter.

266
00:23:09,702 --> 00:23:12,535
It was you?

267
00:23:12,604 --> 00:23:15,300
Well, it wasn't just me.
It was Danglars's idea.

268
00:23:15,374 --> 00:23:18,639
Why didn't you
come to me first?

269
00:23:18,711 --> 00:23:21,373
Why did you keep it a secret from me?
I thought you were my friend.

270
00:23:21,447 --> 00:23:24,575
I told you I gave Napoleon my word.
He lied to me!

271
00:23:24,650 --> 00:23:27,642
I know, Edmond.
I read the letter.

272
00:23:33,358 --> 00:23:35,553
You... You read...

273
00:23:39,364 --> 00:23:41,423
Why are you doing this?

274
00:23:41,500 --> 00:23:46,164
Oh, it's complicated.

275
00:23:48,073 --> 00:23:50,098
Complicated.

276
00:23:52,211 --> 00:23:54,338
Don't be ridiculous.

277
00:23:54,413 --> 00:23:57,849
- Get out of my way.
- I can't let you go, Edmond.

278
00:24:16,568 --> 00:24:18,536
Get away from the window.

279
00:24:21,406 --> 00:24:23,601
Don't make me
take off your hand!

00:24:50,636 --> 00:24:54,629
Why? In God's name, why?

286
00:24:54,706 --> 00:24:58,472
- [Hoofbeats Approaching]
- Because you're the son of a clerk!

287
00:24:58,544 --> 00:25:00,808
And I'm not supposed
to want to be you.

00:25:05,784 --> 00:25:07,911

- [Man] Get!
- Wait.

- [Sword Clatters On Floor]
- [Man] Hold it. Hold it.

292
00:25:23,302 --> 00:25:25,702
To remember better days.

293
00:25:28,073 --> 00:25:30,007
Come on!

294
00:25:32,411 --> 00:25:35,209
I told you it wasn't always
going to be this way, Edmond.

295
00:25:46,992 --> 00:25:50,928
Father! Where is he?

296
00:25:50,996 --> 00:25:53,965
The study.
What's he done now?

297
00:25:54,032 --> 00:25:58,298
Now, you listen to me, Father.
I am the chief magistrate,
an official of the new regime.

298
00:25:58,370 --> 00:26:03,205
I cannot afford to have
my own father mixed up
in treasonous affairs!

299
00:26:04,309 --> 00:26:07,278
You know...
[Chuckles]

300
00:26:07,346 --> 00:26:12,045
In the end, treason
is a matter of dates.

301
00:26:12,117 --> 00:26:17,077
I shall be the patriot,
and you the traitor,
when the emperor returns.

302
00:26:17,155 --> 00:26:19,453
Stop it. Stop it,
you old ruin.

303
00:26:19,524 --> 00:26:24,393
Those days are over.
Napoleon Bonaparte is no longer
the emperor of anything.

304
00:26:24,463 --> 00:26:27,557
If you continue
to dabble in this lunacy,
you run an excellent chance...

305
00:26:27,633 --> 00:26:31,069
of being arrested and ruining
our entire family all because
of your idiotic sympathies.

306
00:26:31,136 --> 00:26:32,865
At least I have sympathies.

307
00:26:32,938 --> 00:26:36,135
For God's sake, Father,
all Valentina is saying...

308
00:26:36,208 --> 00:26:38,802
is that as a family
our fates are intertwined.

309
00:26:38,877 --> 00:26:42,813
- Surely you can see that.
- See? Ah!

310
00:26:42,881 --> 00:26:45,782
I'm an old ruin.

311
00:26:45,851 --> 00:26:49,981
I don't see as well as I did.
You will excuse me.

00:27:36,768 --> 00:27:39,464
- Move it.
- [Whistling]

314
00:27:48,447 --> 00:27:50,381
Move.

315

[Man Screaming]

316
00:27:58,090 --> 00:28:00,456
Welcome, Monsieur Dantes.

317
00:28:00,525 --> 00:28:03,892
I am Armand Dorleac,
the warden of Chateau d'lf.

318
00:28:03,962 --> 00:28:09,059
Monsieur, I know you must
hear this a great deal,

319
00:28:09,134 --> 00:28:13,662
- but I assure you I am innocent.
- [Scoffs]

320
00:28:13,739 --> 00:28:16,367
Everyone must say that,
I know, but I truly am.

321
00:28:16,441 --> 00:28:19,171
- Innocent.
- Yes.

322
00:28:19,244 --> 00:28:22,213
I know. I really do know.

323
00:28:23,448 --> 00:28:27,714
- You mock me?
- No, my dear Dantes.

324
00:28:27,786 --> 00:28:33,053
I know perfectly well
that you are innocent.
Why else would you be here?

325
00:28:33,125 --> 00:28:36,652
- [Liquid Pouring]
- If you were truly guilty,

326
00:28:36,728 --> 00:28:41,256
there are a hundred prisons in France
where they would lock you away,

327
00:28:41,333 --> 00:28:46,737
but Chateau d'lf is where they
put the ones they're ashamed of.

328
00:28:50,242 --> 00:28:53,211
Let's have a look at
your quarters now, shall we?

329
00:29:09,327 --> 00:29:13,661
"God will give me justice."

330
00:29:13,732 --> 00:29:17,190
People are always trying
to motivate themselves.

331
00:29:17,269 --> 00:29:22,400
Or they keep calendars,
but soon they lose interest
or they die.

332
00:29:22,474 --> 00:29:26,501
- There's a window.
- All I'm left with is a rather
unsightly wall, I'm afraid.

333
00:29:26,578 --> 00:29:31,072
So I conceived of another way to help
our prisoners keep track of time.

334
00:29:31,149 --> 00:29:34,118
Every year, on the anniversary
of their imprisonment,

335
00:29:34,186 --> 00:29:36,279
we hurt them.

336
00:29:36,354 --> 00:29:39,016
Usually just

in France this time of year.

- Napoleon has escaped from Elba!
- What?

And tell that idiot clerk
to find the ledger!

We are here to plead the case
of Edmond Dantes, Magistrate.

I am Fernand Mondego,
the son of Count Mondego.

I am here to swear
to Edmond Dantes's innocence.

This is his employer,
Monsieur Morell, his father,
and his fiancee, Mercedes.

Edmond Dantes is charged
with high treason.

- Yet you stand by him?
- Of course I do.

361
00:31:28,700 --> 00:31:32,932
What if I was to tell you
that Dantes is also
charged with murder?

362
00:31:33,004 --> 00:31:36,838
- Murder?
- Edmond would never do such a thing.

363
00:31:36,908 --> 00:31:39,809
Dantes carried a letter from
Napoleon to one of his agents.

364
00:31:39,878 --> 00:31:41,812
When we tried to arrest him,
he killed one of my men.

No, if you knew him,
monsieur, you would know
that was not possible.

just tell us where he is.

I cannot, mademoiselle.
He was handed over to the king's men.

I can understand your pain
at this betrayal.

372
00:32:01,900 --> 00:32:06,997

would be to forget Edmond Dantes,

mademoiselle.

- It's impossible. Never.

receiving the letter to me,

why you were betraying him,

Did Napoleon tell you
who was supposed to
pick up this letter?

- I told him...
- A Monsieur Clarion.

- Nothing. He burnt the letter
and said I could go.

- A dear friend perhaps?
- No. No.

588
00:49:57,508 --> 00:50:00,238
A politician like Villefort
would have rid himself
of such friends.

Monsieur Dorleac!

694
00:58:44,764 --> 00:58:47,198
What do you mean, after three?
We throw him at three or before three?

695
00:58:47,267 --> 00:58:50,759
- After three.
- One... two...

696
00:58:50,837 --> 00:58:53,635
- Monsieur Dorleac!
- And th...

697
00:58:53,706 --> 00:58:56,800
- Don't, Mr. Dorleac!
- One...

698
00:58:56,876 --> 00:59:00,505
- two...
- Don't throw the body over the cliff!

- Three!

So, mi amice,

714
01:01:55,421 --> 01:01:58,822
I would ask who you are,
but in view of your
shredded clothes...

715
01:01:58,891 --> 01:02:02,224
and the fact that
the Chateau d'lf is two miles away,

716
01:02:02,295 --> 01:02:04,126
what's the point?

717
01:02:04,197 --> 01:02:08,998
As for me, I am Luigi Vampa,
a smuggler and a thief.

718
01:02:09,068 --> 01:02:12,401
My men and I have come
to this island to bury alive
one of our number...

719
01:02:12,472 --> 01:02:15,270
who attempted to keep
some stolen gold for himself...

720
01:02:15,341 --> 01:02:17,571
instead of, uh, sharing it
with his comrades.

721
01:02:17,643 --> 01:02:21,101
Interestingly enough, there are some
of his more loyal friends...

722
01:02:21,180 --> 01:02:23,239
who are insisting
that I grant him mercy,

723
01:02:23,316 --> 01:02:25,284
which, of course,
I cannot do,

724
01:02:25,351 --> 01:02:28,843
for I would quickly lose control
of the whole crew.

725
01:02:28,921 --> 01:02:33,358
- That's why you are
such a fortunate find.
- Why is that?

726
01:02:33,426 --> 01:02:36,793
You provide me with a way
to show a little mercy toJacopo,

727
01:02:36,863 --> 01:02:39,195
that maggot you see
tied up over there,

728
01:02:39,265 --> 01:02:42,393
while, at the same time,
not appearing weak.

729
01:02:42,468 --> 01:02:46,165
And as a special treat,
the lads will get to see
a little sport as well.

730
01:02:46,239 --> 01:02:48,332
How do I accomplish
all this?

731
01:02:48,408 --> 01:02:51,707
We watch you and Jacopo
fight to the death.

732
01:02:51,778 --> 01:02:54,645
LfJacopo wins,
we welcome him back to the crew.

733
01:02:54,714 --> 01:02:57,683
If you win, I have given Jacopo
the chance to live,

734
01:02:57,750 --> 01:03:00,685
even if he did not
take advantage of it,

735
01:03:00,753 --> 01:03:03,654
and you can take his place
on the boat.

736
01:03:03,723 --> 01:03:06,214
What if I win,
and I don't want to be a smuggler?

737
01:03:06,292 --> 01:03:09,693
Then we slit your throat,
and we're a bit shorthanded.

738
01:03:11,230 --> 01:03:13,562
I find that smuggling
is the life for me...

739
01:03:13,633 --> 01:03:16,329
and would be delighted
to kill your friend, the maggot.

740
01:03:16,402 --> 01:03:21,101
Oh, uh, by the way,
Jacopo is the best knife
fighter I've ever seen.

741
01:03:22,208 --> 01:03:24,142
Perhaps you should
get out more.

742
01:03:28,614 --> 01:03:30,878
ReleaseJacopo
and give him back his knife.

743
01:03:30,950 --> 01:03:32,918
Then we let
the games begin.

Senor Vampa,
allow Jacopo to live.

750
01:04:13,726 --> 01:04:17,662
He's already suffered enough
with the prospect of being buried alive.

751
01:04:17,730 --> 01:04:20,858
The men that wanted
to see some sport have seen it.

752
01:04:20,933 --> 01:04:23,993
Those who wanted mercy
forJacopo will get it.

753
01:04:24,070 --> 01:04:26,664
And by keeping me
and Jacopo,

754
01:04:26,739 --> 01:04:30,106
you will have yet another skilled sailor
and fighter for your crew.

01:04:34,680 --> 01:04:36,944
It's a deal.

756
01:04:37,016 --> 01:04:39,450
- What is his name?
- [Man] You've got the devil, Jacopo!

757
01:04:39,519 --> 01:04:43,546
His name?
We shall call him Zatarra.

It was my home.

But you do not join
the others ashore.

you cannot make it right

isn't well, monsieur.

Even if he were,
he would not receive visitors
at 11:00 in the evening.

Perhaps he might make
an exception...

- Monsieur Morell?
- Yes?

I was hoping you could tell me where
to find his family.

his father hanged himself...

of Edmond's treason.

- Who knows?

of chief prosecutor.

814
01:09:00,379 --> 01:09:03,712
Of course, the shock of his father's
violent murder...

815
01:09:03,783 --> 01:09:06,377
may also have spurred
his departure.

816
01:09:07,753 --> 01:09:10,984
They were strange times.

- Yes.

of his father and brother in the war,

Fernand became Count Mondego.

01:14:23,802 --> 01:14:25,736
Right.

863
01:14:25,804 --> 01:14:28,602
We kill these people,
then we spend the treasure.

864
01:14:28,674 --> 01:14:32,610
No, we will study them,
learn their weaknesses.

865
01:14:32,678 --> 01:14:35,112
Why not just kill them?
I'll do it.

866
01:14:35,180 --> 01:14:37,944
I'll run up to Paris...
bam, bam, bam, bam!

867
01:14:38,016 --> 01:14:40,780
I'm back before week's end.
We spend the treasure.

868
01:14:40,853 --> 01:14:42,787
How is this a bad plan?

869
01:14:42,855 --> 01:14:45,949
Death is too good for them.

870
01:14:46,024 --> 01:14:48,891
They must suffer
as I suffered.

871
01:14:48,961 --> 01:14:51,623
They must see their world,
all they hold dear,

872
01:14:51,697 --> 01:14:54,222
ripped from them
as it was ripped from me.

873
01:14:58,704 --> 01:15:03,004
You will need a better name than Zatarra
if you are to accomplish that.

874
01:15:09,314 --> 01:15:11,441
Then I shall
become a count.

875
01:15:31,403 --> 01:15:33,997
I bid you
good afternoon, sir.

876
01:15:34,072 --> 01:15:37,166
I'm here to purchase
your lovely home.

877
01:15:37,242 --> 01:15:39,176
[Laughing]

878
01:15:39,244 --> 01:15:43,044
The very cheek!
I shall have you horsewhipped!

879
01:15:43,115 --> 01:15:45,948
Now, get off my property,
you vagabond,

880
01:15:46,018 --> 01:15:48,816
before I set the dogs on you,
you hear?

881
01:15:56,061 --> 01:15:57,995
Thank you.

882
01:16:58,523 --> 01:17:01,549

[Crowd Exclaiming]

885
01:17:11,203 --> 01:17:13,194
Ladies and gentlemen,

886
01:17:13,272 --> 01:17:16,764
it is with great honor
that I present to you His Grace,

887
01:17:16,842 --> 01:17:19,868
the Count of Monte Cristo.

888
01:17:27,653 --> 01:17:30,554
[Fireworks Continue]

889
01:17:33,625 --> 01:17:35,718
It's so beautiful.

890
01:18:43,929 --> 01:18:46,397
Greetings.

891
01:18:46,465 --> 01:18:48,296
[Crowd Murmuring]

892
01:18:48,367 --> 01:18:51,461
[Excited Chattering]

893
01:18:52,871 --> 01:18:56,432
My dear count, allow me to introduce
to you my husband,

894
01:18:56,508 --> 01:18:58,703
Monsieur Villefort,
Chief Prosecutor.

895
01:18:58,777 --> 01:19:00,711
Very kind of you
to think of us.

896
01:19:00,779 --> 01:19:03,612
Oh, I am the one honored
with your presence.

897
01:19:03,682 --> 01:19:06,981
Now, please,
enjoy yourselves tonight.

898
01:19:08,854 --> 01:19:11,084
What do we know about him?

899
01:19:11,156 --> 01:19:13,090
Not enough.

900
01:19:13,158 --> 01:19:15,524
Where are they?
Are you sure you invited them?

901
01:19:15,594 --> 01:19:17,528
Yes, Your Grace.

902
01:19:17,596 --> 01:19:21,623
But I just learned that Count Mondego
has retired for the evening.

903
01:19:21,700 --> 01:19:24,191
He has a morning appointment
he cannot miss.

904
01:19:47,159 --> 01:19:50,458
[Groaning]

905
01:19:50,529 --> 01:19:52,463
[Doors Slam]

906
01:19:57,502 --> 01:20:02,201
[Clock Bell Dinging]

907
01:20:02,274 --> 01:20:04,640
You're up early, my dear.

908
01:20:05,710 --> 01:20:07,644
Is the Viscount Tourville dead?

909
01:20:07,712 --> 01:20:11,842
Unless his heart is situated somewhere
other than the left side of his chest,

910
01:20:11,917 --> 01:20:13,976
I suspect he is.

911
01:20:15,954 --> 01:20:18,718
God grant him peace.

912
01:20:18,790 --> 01:20:21,554
He did no more than defend
his family's honor.

913
01:20:21,626 --> 01:20:24,959
Much good it did him.

914
01:20:25,030 --> 01:20:29,296
His wife and I
were happy in our passion.
You were happy in your ignorance.

915
01:20:29,367 --> 01:20:32,131
Now comes the viscount's
valiant defense of his honor,

916
01:20:32,204 --> 01:20:34,138
and you are pained.

917
01:20:34,206 --> 01:20:37,300
- She is ruined, and he is dead.
- Don't flatter yourself.

918
01:20:37,375 --> 01:20:41,903
I was neither happy
nor ignorant,

919
01:20:41,980 --> 01:20:45,746
having known about the last three women
before Madame Tourville.

920
01:20:45,817 --> 01:20:48,752
I'm sorry you
are humiliated.

921
01:20:50,655 --> 01:20:54,182
The combination of Paris
and me is hardly a recipe for fidelity.

922
01:20:54,259 --> 01:20:57,558
And since my attempts at discretion
have evidently failed,

923
01:20:57,629 --> 01:21:00,757
there seems little point
in keeping up pretenses.

924
01:21:02,901 --> 01:21:06,234
It's actually quite...
liberating.

925
01:21:06,304 --> 01:21:08,238
Wouldn't you say?

926
01:21:10,675 --> 01:21:12,609
[Edmond]
His finances?

927
01:21:12,677 --> 01:21:14,941
[Jacopo] He's losing money
at the other casinos.

928
01:21:15,013 --> 01:21:16,947
They're not even
cheating him.

929
01:21:17,015 --> 01:21:18,949
Have you looked
into his shipping?

930
01:21:19,017 --> 01:21:21,815
He got a bank loan for his own boat
several years ago.

931
01:21:21,887 --> 01:21:25,288
- Doesn't use Danglars.
- Make sure we own
that bank by tomorrow.

932
01:21:25,357 --> 01:21:29,293
Tell the other shipping
companies to stay away from Mondego.

933
01:21:29,361 --> 01:21:31,955
I want to give him no choice
but to crawl back to Danglars.

934
01:21:32,030 --> 01:21:36,399
Now, tell the dealers...
take it all.

935
01:21:39,304 --> 01:21:41,898
Do try to understand.

936
01:21:41,973 --> 01:21:44,908
I have a very large
consignment of cotton ready to be sent,

937
01:21:44,976 --> 01:21:48,537
and I shall make my payment on the ship
as soon as it is delivered.

938
01:21:48,613 --> 01:21:52,572
So obviously I need the vessel
in order to deliver it.

939
01:21:52,651 --> 01:21:57,213
Unfortunately,
the bank can offer no further
extensions, Count Mondego.

940
01:21:57,289 --> 01:22:00,747
I suggest you find
alternate means of shipping.

941
01:22:02,494 --> 01:22:05,088
[Horse Whinnying]

942
01:22:09,000 --> 01:22:13,369
Well, well. To what do I owe the honor,
Count Mondego?

943
01:22:13,438 --> 01:22:17,272
Can't imagine why you've been
avoiding me after all these years.

944
01:22:18,610 --> 01:22:21,044
I'm prepared
to overlook your faults...

945
01:22:21,112 --> 01:22:23,046
and perhaps resume
our dealings.

946
01:22:24,950 --> 01:22:27,748
Business not going
so well these days?

[Wheezing Laugh]

948
01:22:41,032 --> 01:22:42,966

Jacopo.

950
01:22:55,780 --> 01:22:57,805
Did you fall off the bed?

951
01:22:57,882 --> 01:23:02,615
After 13 years of sleeping
on a stone slab, I can't.

952
01:23:02,687 --> 01:23:05,781
Mi Maria.
Does that hurt?

953
01:23:08,393 --> 01:23:10,327
Did you come here
for a reason?

954
01:23:10,395 --> 01:23:12,920
Mondego has a son.

955
01:23:20,005 --> 01:23:23,338
- Albert wishes to talk with us.
- Not now!

956
01:23:23,408 --> 01:23:26,002
Tell him I'm trying
to protect his inheritance.

957
01:23:26,077 --> 01:23:29,012
Are you afraid he's
going to squander his as you have yours?

958
01:23:29,080 --> 01:23:32,948
I don't recall hearing your
complaints when I elevated you
from a fishmonger's daughter.

959
01:23:33,018 --> 01:23:35,282
Please, I must finish this,
then I shall be going out.

960
01:23:35,353 --> 01:23:38,288
May I remind you, my love,
that in Paris there are
mistresses aplenty,

961
01:23:38,356 --> 01:23:41,814
but you have
only one son.

962
01:23:41,893 --> 01:23:43,827
Come in, Albert.

963
01:23:45,196 --> 01:23:48,962
- For God's sake, be brief.
- I will, Father.

964
01:23:49,034 --> 01:23:53,027
Several of my friends
are going to Rome for two weeks
during Carnival.

965
01:23:53,104 --> 01:23:55,265
- I would like to accompany them.
- Rome?

966
01:23:55,340 --> 01:23:58,969
- And no chaperons? You're only 15.
- Almost 16.

967
01:23:59,044 --> 01:24:01,478
Make it my birthday present,
Father, please.

968
01:24:01,546 --> 01:24:03,537
- I won't get into trouble.
- No.

969
01:24:03,615 --> 01:24:07,073
Of course he can go.
I could do with some peace
and quiet around here.

Who are you, and why
are you doing this?

980
01:25:41,679 --> 01:25:44,614
- We are bad men, and for the money.
- My money is in my waistcoat.

981
01:25:44,682 --> 01:25:49,119
Not anymore.
Besides, it's not your money
we're interested in.

982
01:25:49,187 --> 01:25:52,122
You are the only son
of Count Mondego, are you not?

983
01:25:52,190 --> 01:25:55,125
Ransom?
Send your note and be damned.

984
01:25:55,193 --> 01:25:59,129
I wish it were that easy,
but a note won't reach
your father for two weeks,

985
01:25:59,197 --> 01:26:02,530
and then there's the endless
debates about whether
we killed you already.

986
01:26:02,600 --> 01:26:08,095
No, a note just doesn't have the impact.
Perhaps if we send him your ring.

987
01:26:08,173 --> 01:26:10,767
Yes. My ring bears
the Mondego crest.

988
01:26:10,842 --> 01:26:14,869
- While still attached to your finger?
- [Men Laughing]

989

Listen to me, vermin.

990
01:26:19,517 --> 01:26:22,179
I am Albert, son of Fernand,
Count Mondego,

991
01:26:22,253 --> 01:26:26,314
and you have had your last laugh
at my expense.

- Do your worst.
- If you insist. Peppone, the knife.

993
01:26:48,947 --> 01:26:51,108
Cut this boy's ropes,

994
01:26:51,182 --> 01:26:54,674
or I will be forced to start cutting
your miserable corpses.

995
01:26:54,752 --> 01:26:56,686
Now!

996
01:27:00,425 --> 01:27:02,985
Follow me, young man.
You see the surface? Wait for me there.

997
01:27:03,061 --> 01:27:05,962
- I don't know how to thank you.
- Go. We'll talk later.

998
01:27:11,603 --> 01:27:13,628
Well done, gentlemen.

You've had quite an ordeal.

1004
01:27:30,788 --> 01:27:33,416
You're an extraordinary young man.

1005
01:27:34,993 --> 01:27:38,429
I insist, you must come to my estate
for breakfast tomorrow.

1006
01:27:38,496 --> 01:27:41,192
Agreed?

1007
01:27:41,266 --> 01:27:43,200
Agreed.

1008
01:27:44,669 --> 01:27:46,933
May I ask
who you are, sir?

1009
01:27:47,005 --> 01:27:50,270
For the present, your friend.
Tomorrow, your host.

1010
01:27:50,341 --> 01:27:53,174
For the short time
formality stands between us,

01:27:53,244 --> 01:27:55,439
the Count of Monte Cristo.

1012
01:28:28,179 --> 01:28:30,409
He's out in the waiting room.

1013
01:28:31,983 --> 01:28:34,076
He showed courage
in the tunnels.

1014
01:28:34,152 --> 01:28:36,586
He's a means to an end.

1015
01:28:41,159 --> 01:28:43,150
Yes, Your Grace.

1016
01:28:45,096 --> 01:28:47,030

1017
01:28:48,633 --> 01:28:52,296
Albert, come in. Come, come.

1018
01:28:53,504 --> 01:28:55,563
Come on.

1019
01:28:55,640 --> 01:28:57,972
- You've had quite a night.
- Yes.

1020
01:28:58,042 --> 01:29:00,169
[Albert]
What an adventure.

1021
01:29:00,244 --> 01:29:02,974
Everything's an adventure
when you're young.

1022
01:29:03,047 --> 01:29:05,607
- One thing puzzles me, sir.
- Hmm.

1023
01:29:05,683 --> 01:29:08,117
How did you come to know
of my kidnapping?

1024
01:29:08,186 --> 01:29:10,518
I have many connections,

1025
01:29:10,588 --> 01:29:13,455
some of which
are less than reputable.

1026
01:29:13,524 --> 01:29:18,120
I pay well to be informed
of anything of note
in any city in which I stay.

1027
01:29:18,196 --> 01:29:20,756
And the kidnapping
of a count's son is of note.

1028
01:29:23,034 --> 01:29:25,832
But why risk your life
rescuing me?

1029
01:29:25,903 --> 01:29:28,303
The son
of a fellow noble.

1030
01:29:28,373 --> 01:29:30,307
It was the least
I could do.

1031
01:29:30,375 --> 01:29:34,334
Judging by your character,
I'm sure you would have done the same.

1032
01:29:34,412 --> 01:29:37,279
Your father will
be proud of you.

1033
01:29:50,128 --> 01:29:53,495
You must come to Paris
and meet my parents so they
may thank you in person.

1034

Unfortunately, I cannot.

- Even now, the gold...
- The shipment?

Oh, l-I'm sorry, Your Grace.
The shipment is in transit,

1040
01:30:15,053 --> 01:30:17,988
uh, bound for Marseilles.

1041
01:30:18,056 --> 01:30:21,924
- And it arrives?
- Not for another three weeks,
Your Grace.

1042
01:30:21,993 --> 01:30:25,156
Three weeks? That's more
than enough time to visit in Paris.

1043
01:30:27,799 --> 01:30:29,892
- Very well.
- Excellent.

May I present
the Count of Monte Cristo.

- The pleasure is mine,
Count Mondego.

I've been looking forward
to this moment for some time.

01:31:30,528 --> 01:31:33,122
You do me much honor,
when it is I who are indebted to you...

1059
01:32:04,996 --> 01:32:08,591
You would have to be a mother
to truly appreciate the service...

1060
01:32:08,666 --> 01:32:11,430
you've done
for my son and me.

Please, madame,

it was nothing.

01:32:18,743 --> 01:32:22,509
I am sure that within a month,
you will not even remember my name.

You just remind me
of someone from long ago,

someone who was
very dear to me.

1075
01:33:05,523 --> 01:33:08,754
I'm flattered.
What happened to him?

1076

He died.

- What are you doing here?
- Oh, Madame Villefort, monsieur.

1082
01:33:40,358 --> 01:33:43,293
I'm so glad you could come to see me
while I'm still in town.

- We were delightfully
surprised to get your note.
- Thank you.

1084

Would you be so kind
as to excuse your husband
and I for a moment?

1085
01:33:52,303 --> 01:33:56,296
I'm told you are an expert
in the interpretation
of the law.

1086
01:33:56,374 --> 01:33:59,901
I have a certain matter
that perhaps you could
help me with.

Excuse me.

Albert expects it.

You give it, my dear.
I'm sure it'll be splendid.

You are his father!

1093
01:34:25,903 --> 01:34:29,805
It is the least you can do.
You know how he admires you.

1094
01:34:29,874 --> 01:34:31,842
Then he will forgive
my absence.

1095

But...

1096
01:34:35,680 --> 01:34:38,148
I thought we agreed
not to meet socially.

1097
01:34:39,917 --> 01:34:43,182
How could I pass up
the Count of Monte Cristo?

1098
01:34:44,755 --> 01:34:47,451
Quite.

1099
01:34:47,525 --> 01:34:50,653

- He's foreign,

1101
01:34:53,197 --> 01:34:55,358
I hear he aided
your son.

01:34:55,433 --> 01:34:59,096
- Why does he seek your counsel?
- Why should I tell you?

1103
01:34:59,170 --> 01:35:02,799
When my son
returned from Rome,

1104
01:35:02,873 --> 01:35:06,274
he mentioned he'd
heard Monte Cristo saying
he was expecting a shipment.

1105
01:35:06,344 --> 01:35:08,938
He also heard the words "gold"...

1106
01:35:09,013 --> 01:35:10,810
and "Spada."

1107
01:35:12,550 --> 01:35:15,678
- Hmm.
- You don't believe...

1108
01:35:15,753 --> 01:35:18,278
Monte Cristo has found
the treasure of Spada.

1109
01:35:18,356 --> 01:35:21,450
Not an hour ago,
he asked me to help him avoid
troublesome inspections...

1110
01:35:21,525 --> 01:35:23,993
on a shipment coming
from Marseilles.

1111
01:35:24,061 --> 01:35:26,529
- Hmm.
- I could have him arrested.

1112
01:35:26,597 --> 01:35:30,499
Don't do that.
Let's just relieve him of it.

1113

- I have an acquaintance
who deals in these matters.

Tell Monte Cristo
you'll get his shipment through Customs,

1115
01:35:36,941 --> 01:35:39,933
but that it will
have to stay in port overnight.

1116
01:35:40,010 --> 01:35:43,741
I shall have it removed
and taken to my old family
estate in Bouchon,

the following day.

to beg the count...

to allow me to give
the birthday toast to Albert.

1132

I was so insistent, and such
is the graciousness of our host,

his fatherly right...

I watched as the criminals,
who tied Albert to a wall,

threatened to cut off
his finger and send it to his father...

1142

from a certain merchant ship.

1218
01:44:21,127 --> 01:44:23,687
I hope you don't mind
if I join you for a short while.

I was not expecting you.

I want to thank you in person
for helping me with my shipment.

1221
01:44:31,705 --> 01:44:34,697
That, yes. L-I made all
the arrangements earlier.

I can promise you there'll be
no more problems from our end.

could be the start of a long

Speaking of which,
may I pose a question?

1225

Yes, of course.
Anything in the world.

1226
01:44:52,158 --> 01:44:55,650
I was just curious.

1227
01:44:55,729 --> 01:44:59,563
Why did you tell
Countess Mondego 16 years ago...

1228
01:44:59,633 --> 01:45:02,932
that Edmond Dantes
had been executed?

1229
01:45:03,003 --> 01:45:04,937
Hmm?

1230
01:45:05,005 --> 01:45:08,771
Uh, I don't understand.
Wh-What on earth are you talking about?

1231
01:45:08,842 --> 01:45:11,902
It's a perfectly
simple question.

1232
01:45:11,978 --> 01:45:13,775
How do you know these things?

1233
01:45:15,548 --> 01:45:18,381
- [Grinding Sound]
- That's, uh...

1234
01:45:18,451 --> 01:45:20,942
That's quite enough.

1235
01:45:21,021 --> 01:45:24,354
Whew! You don't understand.
Dantes was accepting
a letter from Napoleon.

1236
01:45:24,424 --> 01:45:27,416
- That was clearly treason.
- But we both know
he never delivered it.

1237
01:45:27,494 --> 01:45:30,861
Packing a man off to prison
with such knowledge
is bad enough. But to tell...

1238
01:45:30,931 --> 01:45:33,729
Your Grace, I have no idea
what is provoking
this perverse discussion.

1239
01:45:33,800 --> 01:45:38,294
Now I ask myself,
"What did my old friend
Villefort stand to gain...

1240
01:45:38,371 --> 01:45:41,704
by telling Mercedes
that Edmond Dantes is dead?"

1241
01:45:43,710 --> 01:45:46,907
The answer is...
absolutely nothing.

1242
01:45:46,980 --> 01:45:49,540
Just as you say, nothing.
So why...

1243
01:45:49,616 --> 01:45:52,107
But if my old friend,
now chief prosecutor of France,

1244
01:45:52,185 --> 01:45:54,813
doesn't gain from this lie,
well, who does?

1245
01:45:56,990 --> 01:45:59,982
My dear Count, it's far too hot in here
and you're fully dressed.

1246
01:46:00,060 --> 01:46:02,790
- It's time we both left.
- I think the clearest beneficiary...

1247
01:46:02,862 --> 01:46:04,887
is Fernand, Count Mondego.

1248
01:46:08,401 --> 01:46:11,928
I don't understand what
this inquisition has to do
with our business relationship.

1249
01:46:12,005 --> 01:46:14,337
I'm about to tell you.

1250
01:46:17,377 --> 01:46:19,311
Sit down, Mondego.

1251
01:46:20,814 --> 01:46:23,647
I'm an ambitious man.
And I have furthered these ambitions...

1252
01:46:23,717 --> 01:46:25,947
by scooping up Bonapartists.

1253
01:46:27,354 --> 01:46:29,345
But now with Napoleon
on the loose, I have,

1254
01:46:29,422 --> 01:46:31,913
shall I say,
a thorn in my side.

1255
01:46:31,992 --> 01:46:34,984
Once merely an irritation,
now potentially lethal.

1256
01:46:35,061 --> 01:46:37,825
- Be lethal in turn.
- Well, the problem is such...

1257
01:46:37,897 --> 01:46:40,388
that I, myself,
cannot attend to it.

1258
01:46:40,467 --> 01:46:42,697
So I have a proposition
for you.

1259
01:46:47,307 --> 01:46:49,502

no friend of mine.

of Napoleon, wasn't he?

Possibly involved in plotting
Napoleon's escape from Elba.

01:57:21,574 --> 01:57:24,134
King's to you, Fernand.

1367
01:57:31,817 --> 01:57:34,809
[Panting]
Edmond?

1368
01:57:36,589 --> 01:57:38,819
But how...

1369
01:57:38,891 --> 01:57:43,385
How did I escape?
With difficulty.

1370
01:57:43,462 --> 01:57:48,331
How did I plan this moment?
With pleasure.

1371
01:57:48,401 --> 01:57:51,632
- [Thunder Rumbling]
- So you've taken Mercedes?

1372
01:57:51,704 --> 01:57:54,104
And everything else...

1373
01:57:54,173 --> 01:57:56,141
except your life.

1374
01:57:58,310 --> 01:58:00,369
Why are you doing this?

1375
01:58:00,446 --> 01:58:03,108
It's complicated.

1376
01:58:04,583 --> 01:58:08,849
Let's just say it's vengeance
for the life you stole from me.

1377
01:58:19,265 --> 01:58:22,132
Well, I see someone
has taught you the sword.

1378
01:58:22,201 --> 01:58:25,068
How did you ever
call yourself my friend?

1379
01:58:25,137 --> 01:58:28,504
- We were friends, Edmond.
- [Yells]

1380
01:58:28,574 --> 01:58:31,338
You sent me to hell!

1381
01:58:31,410 --> 01:58:33,378
Why?

1382
01:58:35,047 --> 01:58:37,607
Take your vengeance.
[Panting]

1383
01:58:37,683 --> 01:58:40,379
But know the blood
you spill is noble.

1384
01:58:42,321 --> 01:58:44,312
Blood that will never
run through your veins.

1385
01:58:44,390 --> 01:58:46,381
You're no more a count
than I am a commoner!

1386
01:58:49,995 --> 01:58:52,225
[Grunting]

1387
01:58:54,800 --> 01:58:57,564
You don't have it in you.

1388
01:59:03,142 --> 01:59:06,839
- Touch him, and I'll kill you.
- Boy, let me explain.

1389
01:59:06,912 --> 01:59:10,609
It's been explained.
I spoke to Madame Villefort
on the street.

1390
01:59:10,683 --> 01:59:13,413
She told me how I was a silly,
trusting dupe that my friend,

1391
01:59:13,486 --> 01:59:15,954
the Count of Monte Cristo,
used to get into our lives.

1392
01:59:16,021 --> 01:59:17,955
- Albert, listen to me.
- I will not!

1393
01:59:18,023 --> 01:59:21,151
Forgive me for being
such a fool, Father.

1394
01:59:21,227 --> 01:59:23,286
You were betrayed.
Of course you're forgiven.

1395
01:59:23,362 --> 01:59:25,523
You were my friend.
I looked up to you.

1396
01:59:25,598 --> 01:59:27,589
There's a history here
you know nothing about.

1397
01:59:27,666 --> 01:59:30,533
He loved your mother,
and yet she chose me.

1398
01:59:30,603 --> 01:59:33,071
- Now he intends to steal her away.
- Lie. Get out of my way!

1399
01:59:36,142 --> 01:59:39,578
Boy, if I have to,
I will kill you.

1400
01:59:39,645 --> 01:59:41,806
I will not stop now.

1401
01:59:41,881 --> 01:59:44,645
- Nor will I.
- So be it.

1402
01:59:44,717 --> 01:59:46,912
[Mercedes Shouting]
No!

1403
01:59:56,195 --> 01:59:57,457
[Clicks]

1404
02:00:04,403 --> 02:00:08,066
Albert,

1405
02:00:08,140 --> 02:00:11,974
I found the note you left
explaining where you'd gone.

1406
02:00:12,044 --> 02:00:17,209
But now I must
explain something to you.

1407
02:00:17,283 --> 02:00:19,945
Where you really come from.

1408
02:00:20,019 --> 02:00:24,080
Albert, you are
the son of Edmond Dantes.

1409
02:00:30,696 --> 02:00:33,859
The man you know as
the Count of Monte Cristo.

1410
02:00:48,180 --> 02:00:50,205
Well, I'm afraid
it is true.

1411
02:00:50,282 --> 02:00:53,774
You are the walking proof
that your mother
was as much of a whore...

1412
02:00:53,853 --> 02:00:56,344
in her younger years
as she is today.

1413
02:00:56,422 --> 02:00:58,549
[Albert]
You...

1414
02:01:01,760 --> 02:01:03,785
You let me fight him?

1415
02:01:03,863 --> 02:01:06,661
It didn't do
any good though, did it?

1416
02:01:06,732 --> 02:01:09,360
Fernand, I beg you.
No more!

1417
02:01:09,435 --> 02:01:11,369
I want no more of this.

1418
02:01:12,738 --> 02:01:17,402
Just go.
Call it mercy.

1419
02:01:17,476 --> 02:01:19,467
Mercy, Fernand.

1420
02:01:25,751 --> 02:01:31,087
You've only got one shot,
and it will take
more than that to stop me.

1421
02:01:31,156 --> 02:01:34,751
Well, then I'd best
put it where it will do
the most damage.

1422
02:01:36,428 --> 02:01:38,726
[Albert]
No!

1423
02:01:38,797 --> 02:01:41,265
Mother! Mother!

1424
02:01:41,333 --> 02:01:45,030
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
Look what I've done. Jacopo!

1425
02:01:48,774 --> 02:01:50,674
Hyah!

1426
02:01:55,514 --> 02:01:57,573
Once again, Zatarra,

1427
02:01:57,650 --> 02:01:59,982
God sees you out of
the corner of His eye.

1428
02:02:00,052 --> 02:02:01,986
She'll live.

1429
02:02:06,926 --> 02:02:08,359
[Whinnies]

1430
02:02:34,987 --> 02:02:37,455
- [Fernand] Edmond!
- [Whimpers]

1431
02:02:37,523 --> 02:02:40,549
Edmond!

1432
02:02:40,626 --> 02:02:44,392
Please don't go
out there. Don't.

1433
02:02:44,463 --> 02:02:46,556
Edmond, don't go.

1434
02:02:46,632 --> 02:02:50,227
You try.
Don't ever quit.

1435
02:02:50,302 --> 02:02:52,770
Zatarra,

1436
02:02:52,838 --> 02:02:55,966
you must end this.

1437
02:02:57,643 --> 02:03:01,101
Even the priest
will understand that.

1438
02:03:01,180 --> 02:03:05,276
- Edmond!
- [Mercedes Whispering]
Please don't leave.

1439
02:03:07,553 --> 02:03:10,317
Watch over your mother.

1440
02:03:30,009 --> 02:03:35,311
Now, I couldn't live in a world
where you have everything
and I have nothing.

1441
02:04:57,863 --> 02:04:59,524
[Groans]

1442
02:05:16,148 --> 02:05:18,810
What happened
to your mercy?

1443
02:05:18,884 --> 02:05:23,787
I'm a count,
not a saint.

1444
02:05:23,856 --> 02:05:27,519
[Panting]

1445
02:06:04,463 --> 02:06:08,957
You were right, priest.
You were right.

1446
02:06:10,669 --> 02:06:13,035
This I promise you...

1447
02:06:13,105 --> 02:06:17,474
and God:

1448
02:06:17,543 --> 02:06:20,706
All that was used
for vengeance...

1449
02:06:20,779 --> 02:06:25,045
will now be used for good.

1450
02:06:25,117 --> 02:06:29,349
So rest in peace, my friend.

1451
02:06:29,421 --> 02:06:32,652
So, Zatarra,

1452
02:06:32,724 --> 02:06:34,885
painful, huh?

1453
02:06:34,960 --> 02:06:37,793
No.

1454
02:06:43,268 --> 02:06:48,433
I bought this place,
thinking one day
I would tear it down.

1455
02:06:48,507 --> 02:06:51,169
But now the only things
I care about...

1456
02:06:51,243 --> 02:06:55,680
are walking off
this island with me.

1457
02:06:55,747 --> 02:06:58,580
Let's go home.
